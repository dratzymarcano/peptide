# Buy Selank for Research

**Selank** is a synthetic heptapeptide derivative of the naturally occurring immunomodulatory peptide Tuftsin. It was developed at the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Russian Academy of Sciences. **For laboratory research use only.**

## Research Context

Selank is characterized as a regulatory peptide with anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) and nootropic properties in research literature.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Anxiety Models:** Animal studies (e.g., elevated plus maze) have shown Selank to reduce anxiety-like behaviors without sedation.
*   **BDNF Expression:** Research indicates Selank may increase the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus.
*   **Immune Modulation:** Like its parent peptide Tuftsin, Selank is investigated for its effects on the immune system, particularly IL-6 regulation.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro
*   **Molecular Formula:** C33H57N11O9
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Is this a drug?**
A: In Russia, it is used as a pharmaceutical. In the EU and US, it is an unapproved research chemical and is sold strictly for laboratory investigation.

**Q: How is it administered in research?**
A: Most studies utilize intranasal or subcutaneous administration.
