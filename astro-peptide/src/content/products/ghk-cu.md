# Buy GHK-Cu (Copper Peptide) for Research

**GHK-Cu** is a naturally occurring copper complex of the tripeptide glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine. It is found in human plasma, saliva, and urine. This product is intended solely for **laboratory research and development**.

## Research Context

GHK-Cu has been a subject of study since its isolation in 1973. It is primarily investigated for its potential roles in tissue remodeling, anti-inflammatory actions, and DNA repair modulation.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Collagen Synthesis:** *In-vitro* studies using dermal fibroblasts have shown that GHK-Cu can stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, key components of the extracellular matrix.
*   **Wound Healing Models:** Animal models suggest GHK-Cu may accelerate wound closure and improve the quality of scarring by modulating metalloproteinase activity.
*   **Stem Cell Research:** Recent research explores the ability of GHK-Cu to restore the proliferative potential of mesenchymal stem cells.
*   **Anti-Inflammatory Effects:** The peptide is studied for its ability to lower the level of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines in tissue cultures.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Gly-His-Lys (complexed with Cu2+)
*   **Molecular Formula:** C14H24N6O4Cu
*   **Solubility:** Highly soluble in water.
*   **Appearance:** Blue crystalline powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C. Hygroscopic; keep tightly sealed.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C. Use within 2-3 weeks. The solution is typically blue.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Copper Content:** Verified to be within stoichiometric range (1:1 molar ratio).
*   **Appearance:** Visual inspection confirms characteristic blue color.

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Can I use this for cosmetic formulations?**
A: This specific product is sold as a research reagent. While GHK-Cu is an ingredient in some cosmetics, our product is not manufactured under cosmetic GMP standards and is for laboratory use only.

**Q: Why is the powder blue?**
A: The blue color is characteristic of the copper ion (Cu2+) complexed with the peptide.

**Q: What is the pH of the solution?**
A: A 1% solution in water typically has a pH around 6.0-7.0.
