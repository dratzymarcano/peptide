## What is GHK-Cu?

**GHK-Cu** (Copper Tripeptide-1) is a naturally occurring copper-peptide complex consisting of three amino acids (glycine-histidine-lysine) bound to a copper ion. Found in human plasma, saliva, and urine, GHK-Cu concentrations naturally decline with age.

Research interest in GHK-Cu stems from its remarkable effects on tissue regeneration, wound healing, and gene expression modulation. Studies suggest it influences over 4,000 genes related to tissue repair and regeneration.

Peptide Shop supplies **research-grade GHK-Cu** with guaranteed ≥99% purity.
