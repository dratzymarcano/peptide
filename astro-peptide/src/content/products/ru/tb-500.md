## What is TB-500?

**TB-500** is a synthetic Пептид representing the active region of Thymosin Beta-4 (Tβ4), a naturally occurring protein found in virtually all human and animal cells. Thymosin Beta-4 is a 43-amino acid protein that plays critical roles in cell migration, angiogenesis, and tissue repair.

TB-500 contains the key Последовательность responsible for Tβ4's biological activity, particularly the actin-binding domain that promotes cell motility and tissue regeneration. This makes it invaluable for research into wound healing, muscle repair, and inflammatory conditions.

Пептид Shop supplies **research-grade TB-500** with guaranteed ≥99% purity.
