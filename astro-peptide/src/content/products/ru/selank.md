FAQs:
  - question: "What is Selank used for in research?"
    answer: "Selank is studied for anxiolytic effects, cognitive enhancement, immune modulation, and neurotransmitter regulation. It's based on the natural peptide tuftsin."
  - question: "How does Selank work?"
    answer: "Selank modulates GABA, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine systems. It also influences BDNF and enkephalin expression."
  - question: "How is Selank different from Semax?"
    answer: "Selank is primarily anxiolytic with cognitive Преимущества, while Semax is more focused on cognitive enhancement. Selank is based on tuftsin; Semax on ACTH."
  - question: "How should Selank be stored?"
    answer: "Store lyophilised Selank at -20°C. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 3-4 weeks."
  - question: "What Чистота is your Selank?"
    answer: "Our Selank is ≥99% pure as verified by ВЭЖХ. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis."
  - question: "What is tuftsin?"
    answer: "Tuftsin is a naturally occurring immunomodulatory tetrapeptide. Selank extends tuftsin with additional amino acids for enhanced stability and activity."
  - question: "How do I reconstitute Selank?"
    answer: "Reconstitute in sterile bacteriostatic water. Add solvent slowly and gently swirl to dissolve."
  - question: "What sizes are available?"
    answer: "Selank is available in 5mg and 10mg vials."

## What is Selank?

**Selank** (TP-7) is a synthetic heptapeptide developed in Russia as a modified analogue of tuftsin, a naturally occurring immunomodulatory peptide. Selank has been extensively studied for its anxiolytic, nootropic, and immunomodulatory properties.

Unlike benzodiazepines, Selank does not produce sedation or dependence, making it a valuable tool for researching anxiety mechanisms and novel therapeutic approaches.

Peptide Магазин supplies **research-grade Selank** with guaranteed ≥99% Чистота.

## How Does Selank Work?

### GABA System
- **GABAergic modulation** - Receptor effects
- **Anxiolytic action** - Anxiety reduction
- **Non-sedating** - Preserved alertness

### Monoamine Regulation
- **Serotonin effects** - 5-HT modulation
- **Dopamine influence** - Reward pathways
- **Norepinephrine** - Attention regulation

### Neuroprotection
- **BDNF expression** - Neuroplasticity
- **Enkephalins** - Endogenous opioids
- **Anti-inflammatory** - CNS protection

## Research Applications

### Anxiety Research
- **Anxiolytic mechanisms** - Non-benzodiazepine
- **Stress response** - Adaptation
- **Fear conditioning** - Learning

### Cognitive Research
- **Memory enhancement** - Encoding/retrieval
- **Attention** - Focus regulation
- **Neuroprotection** - Brain health

### Immunology
- **Immune modulation** - Tuftsin-based
- **Inflammation** - Regulation
