faqs: 
- question: "What is Epitalon used for in research?"
answer: "Epitalon is studied for telomerase activation, cellular ageing, melatonin regulation, and longevity mechanisms. It was developed from pineal gland research."
- question: "How does Epitalon work?"
answer: "Epitalon is reported to activate telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomere length. It may also influence melatonin synthesis and circadian rhythms."
- question: "What is the origin of Epitalon?"
answer: "Epitalon is a synthetic tetrapeptide based on epithalamin, a pineal gland extract studied by Russian researchers for its anti-ageing properties."
- question: "How should Epitalon be stored?"
answer: "Store lyophilised Epitalon at -20°C. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 4 weeks."
- question: "What purity is your Epitalon?"
answer: "Our Epitalon is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis."
- question: "What are telomeres?"
answer: "Telomeres are protective DNA caps at chromosome ends that shorten with each cell division. Telomerase can extend them."
- question: "How do I reconstitute Epitalon?"
answer: "Reconstitute in sterile bacteriostatic water. Add solvent slowly and gently swirl to dissolve."
- question: "What sizes are available?"
answer: "Epitalon is available in 10mg, 20mg, and 50mg vials."

## What is Epitalon?

**Epitalon** (Epithalon, AEDG Пептид) is a synthetic tetraПептид based on epithalamin, a pineal gland extract extensively studied for its effects on telomerase activation and cellular ageing. Developed from decades of Russian research, Epitalon has become a key tool in longevity and anti-ageing research.

The Пептид's primary interest lies in its reported ability to activate telomerase, potentially influencing cellular lifespan and age-related changes.

Пептид Shop supplies **research-grade Epitalon** with guaranteed ≥99% purity.
