faqs:
- question: "What makes Retatrutide unique compared to other incretin peptides?"
  answer: "Retatrutide is a triple agonist that activates GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors simultaneously. This distinguishes it from dual agonists like tirzepatide (GIP/GLP-1) and mono-agonists like semaglutide (GLP-1 only), providing researchers a novel tool for studying multi-receptor metabolic effects."
- question: "What is Retatrutide used for in research?"
  answer: "Retatrutide is used in metabolic research to study triple receptor activation effects on glucose homeostasis, weight management, energy expenditure, hepatic lipid metabolism, and appetite regulation. The glucagon component adds unique thermogenic and lipolytic research applications."
- question: "How should Retatrutide be stored?"
  answer: "Store lyophilised Retatrutide at -20°C for optimal stability. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 3-4 weeks. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles and protect from light exposure."
- question: "What purity is your Retatrutide?"
  answer: "Our Retatrutide is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC analysis. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis with purity data, mass spectrometry identity confirmation, and peptide content analysis."
- question: "How does the glucagon component contribute to research?"
  answer: "The glucagon receptor agonism provides unique research opportunities in studying hepatic glucose production, thermogenesis, lipolysis, and energy expenditure mechanisms not achievable with GLP-1/GIP dual agonists alone."
- question: "What is the half-life of Retatrutide?"
  answer: "Retatrutide has an extended half-life of approximately 6 days due to fatty acid modifications that enable albumin binding. This allows researchers to study sustained triple receptor activation effects."
- question: "How do I reconstitute Retatrutide?"
  answer: "Reconstitute in sterile bacteriostatic water or slightly alkaline buffer (pH 7.4-8.0). Add solvent slowly along the vial wall and gently swirl to dissolve. Avoid shaking vigorously."
- question: "What sizes are available?"
  answer: "Retatrutide is available in 5mg and 10mg vials. Larger quantities are available for institutional research projects - contact us for bulk pricing."

## What is Retatrutide?

**Retatrutide** (LY3437943) is a novel synthetic Пептид that functions as a triple agonist of three key metabolic receptors: glucagon-like Пептид-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polyПептид (GIP), and glucagon receptors. This unprecedented triple Механизм действия makes Retatrutide the most comprehensive incretin-based research tool currently available.

The Пептид represents the next evolution beyond dual agonists like tirzepatide, adding glucagon receptor activation to the established GLP-1/GIP dual agonism. This triple receptor engagement enables researchers to Исследование the complex interplay between these metabolic signalling systems and their combined effects on glucose homeostasis, energy expenditure, and body weight regulation.
