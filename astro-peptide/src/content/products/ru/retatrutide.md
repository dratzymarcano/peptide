FAQs:
  - question: "What makes Retatrutide unique compared to other incretin Пептиды?"
    answer: "Retatrutide is a triple agonist that activates GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors simultaneously. This distinguishes it from dual agonists like tirzepatide (GIP/GLP-1) and mono-agonists like semaglutide (GLP-1 only), providing researchers a novel tool for studying multi-receptor metabolic effects."
  - question: "What is Retatrutide used for in research?"
    answer: "Retatrutide is used in metabolic research to study triple receptor activation effects on glucose Главнаяostasis, weight management, energy expenditure, hepatic lipid metabolism, and appetite regulation. The glucagon component adds unique thermogenic and lipolytic research applications."
  - question: "How should Retatrutide be stored?"
    answer: "Store lyophilised Retatrutide at -20°C for optimal stability. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 3-4 weeks. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles and protect from light exposure."
  - question: "What Чистота is your Retatrutide?"
    answer: "Our Retatrutide is ≥99% pure as verified by ВЭЖХ analysis. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis with Чистота data, Масс-спектрометрия identity confirmation, and peptide content analysis."
  - question: "How does the glucagon component contribute to research?"
    answer: "The glucagon receptor agonism provides unique research opportunities in studying hepatic glucose production, thermogenesis, lipolysis, and energy expenditure mechanisms not achievable with GLP-1/GIP dual agonists alone."
  - question: "What is the half-life of Retatrutide?"
    answer: "Retatrutide has an extended half-life of approximately 6 days due to fatty acid modifications that enable albumin binding. This allows researchers to study sustained triple receptor activation effects."
  - question: "How do I reconstitute Retatrutide?"
    answer: "Reconstitute in sterile bacteriostatic water or slightly alkaline buffer (pH 7.4-8.0). Add solvent slowly along the vial wall and gently swirl to dissolve. Avoid shaking vigorously."
  - question: "What sizes are available?"
    answer: "Retatrutide is available in 5mg and 10mg vials. Larger quantities are available for institutional research projects - Контакты us for bulk pricing."

## What is Retatrutide?

**Retatrutide** (LY3437943) is a novel synthetic peptide that functions as a triple agonist of three key metabolic receptors: Глюкагоноподобный пептид-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon receptors. This unprecedented triple mechanism of action makes Retatrutide the most comprehensive incretin-based research tool currently available.

The peptide represents the next evolution beyond dual agonists like tirzepatide, adding glucagon receptor activation to the established GLP-1/GIP dual agonism. This triple receptor engagement enables researchers to study the complex interplay between these metabolic signalling systems and their combined effects on glucose Главнаяostasis, energy expenditure, and body weight regulation.

Peptide Магазин supplies **research-grade Retatrutide** with guaranteed ≥99% Чистота, verified through comprehensive ВЭЖХ and Масс-спектрометрия analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis, ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.

## How Does Retatrutide Work?

Retatrutide's triple agonism creates a unique pharmacological profile by simultaneously engaging three complementary receptor systems, each contributing distinct metabolic effects.

### GLP-1 Receptor Activation

The GLP-1 component provides established incretin effects:
- **Glucose-dependent insulin secretion** - Enhanced pancreatic beta-cell response
- **Glucagon suppression** - Reduced hepatic glucose output
- **Appetite reduction** - Central satiety signalling
- **Gastric emptying delay** - Prolonged nutrient absorption

### GIP Receptor Activation

GIP receptor engagement adds complementary effects:
- **Enhanced insulin secretion** - Synergistic with GLP-1 effects
- **Adipose tissue effects** - Potential insulin sensitisation
- **Beta-cell preservation** - Supportive effects on islet function
- **Bone metabolism** - Research area of emerging interest

### Glucagon Receptor Activation

The unique glucagon component provides:
- **Thermogenesis** - Increased energy expenditure
- **Lipolysis** - Enhanced fat mobilisation
- **Hepatic effects** - Altered glucose and lipid metabolism
- **Appetite modulation** - Additional satiety mechanisms

### Synergistic Metabolic Effects

The triple combination creates unique research opportunities:
- **Enhanced Похудение mechanisms** - Multiple complementary pathways
- **Improved metabolic flexibility** - Coordinated fuel utilisation
- **Hepatic lipid reduction** - Potential effects on fatty liver
- **Cardiovascular parameters** - Emerging research focus

## Research Applications of Retatrutide

Retatrutide enables essential comparative studies:
- **Mono vs dual vs triple agonism** - Understanding receptor contribution
- **Glucagon's metabolic role** - Separating from GLP-1/GIP effects
- **Receptor selectivity** - Optimising therapeutic profiles

### Weight Management Studies

The triple agonist provides comprehensive weight research tools:
- **Enhanced efficacy mechanisms** - Understanding superior outcomes
- **Thermogenic effects** - Glucagon-mediated energy expenditure
- **Appetite regulation** - Multiple satiety pathways
- **Body composition** - Effects on fat vs lean mass

### Hepatic Metabolism Research

Glucagon's hepatic effects enable liver-focused studies:
- **Hepatic lipid metabolism** - NAFLD/NASH research applications
- **Glucose production** - Understanding hepatic glucose output
- **Fatty acid oxidation** - Studying lipid utilisation pathways

### Energy Expenditure Studies

The thermogenic component opens unique research directions:
- **Brown adipose tissue activation** - Glucagon-mediated effects
- **Metabolic rate changes** - Understanding energy expenditure
- **Cold-induced thermogenesis** - Synergy with glucagon signalling
