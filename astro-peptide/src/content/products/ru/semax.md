faqs:
- question: "What is Semax used for in research?"
  answer: "Semax is studied for cognitive enhancement, neuroprotection, BDNF modulation, and neurotransmitter regulation. It's based on ACTH(4-10)."
- question: "How does Semax work?"
  answer: "Semax modulates neurotrophins (BDNF, NGF), influences dopamine and serotonin, and affects gene expression related to neuroplasticity."
- question: "How is Semax different from Selank?"
  answer: "Semax focuses on cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection; Selank is more anxiolytic. Semax is based on ACTH; Selank on tuftsin."
- question: "How should Semax be stored?"
  answer: "Store lyophilised Semax at -20°C. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 3-4 weeks."
- question: "What purity is your Semax?"
  answer: "Our Semax is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis."
- question: "What is BDNF?"
  answer: "BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) is crucial for neuroplasticity, learning, and memory. Semax is reported to enhance BDNF expression."
- question: "How do I reconstitute Semax?"
  answer: "Reconstitute in sterile bacteriostatic water. Add solvent slowly and gently swirl to dissolve."
- question: "What sizes are available?"
  answer: "Semax is available in 5mg, 10mg, and 30mg vials."

## What is Semax?

**Semax** is a synthetic heptaПептид developed in Russia, based on the ACTH(4-10) fragment of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Unlike full ACTH, Semax lacks hormonal activity but retains potent nootropic and neuroprotective properties.

Extensive research has demonstrated Semax's effects on cognitive function, BDNF expression, and neuroprotection, making it a valuable tool for neuroscience research.

Пептид Shop supplies **research-grade Semax** with guaranteed ≥99% purity.

## How Does Semax Work?

### Neurotrophin Modulation
- **BDNF upregulation** - Neuroplasticity
- **NGF effects** - Nerve growth
- **TrkB activation** - Receptor signalling

### Neurotransmitter Effects
- **Dopamine modulation** - Motivation, reward
- **Serotonin effects** - Mood regulation
- **Acetylcholine** - Memory, learning

### Gene Expression
- **Immediate early genes** - c-Fos, Arc
- **Plasticity genes** - Synaptic changes
- **Neuroprotective genes** - Cell survival

## Research Applications

### Cognitive Research
- **Learning enhancement** - Memory formation
- **Attention** - Focus regulation
- **Executive function** - Decision-making

### Neuroprotection
- **Stroke models** - Ischemia research
- **Neurodegenerative** - Disease models
- **Oxidative stress** - Protection

### Neuroplasticity
- **BDNF signalling** - Growth factor pathways
- **Synaptogenesis** - New connections
- **LTP enhancement** - Memory mechanisms
