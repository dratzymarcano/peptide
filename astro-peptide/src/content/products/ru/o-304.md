faqs:
- question: "What is O-304 used for in research?"
  answer: "O-304 is studied as a direct AMPK activator for metabolic research, including glucose metabolism, lipid oxidation, and energy homeostasis."
- question: "How does O-304 work?"
  answer: "O-304 directly activates AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) by binding to the β1 subunit, enhancing cellular energy regulation."
- question: "What is AMPK?"
  answer: "AMPK is a master metabolic regulator that senses cellular energy status and coordinates anabolic/catabolic processes. It's activated by low energy states."
- question: "How should O-304 be stored?"
  answer: "Store O-304 at -20°C protected from light and moisture. Reconstituted solutions should be used promptly."
- question: "What purity is your O-304?"
  answer: "Our O-304 is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis."
- question: "How is O-304 different from metformin?"
  answer: "O-304 directly activates AMPK while metformin works indirectly through mitochondrial inhibition. O-304 is more selective."
- question: "How do I prepare O-304 solutions?"
  answer: "Dissolve in DMSO for stock solutions. Dilute in aqueous buffers for working concentrations."
- question: "What sizes are available?"
  answer: "O-304 is available in 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg quantities."

## What is O-304?

**O-304** is a novel small molecule that directly activates AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), the master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. Unlike indirect activators like metformin, O-304 binds directly to AMPK's β1 subunit.

Research interest in O-304 stems from its potential applications in metabolic disease, diabetes, and obesity research, where AMPK activation can improve glucose uptake and lipid oxidation.

Пептид Shop supplies **research-grade O-304** with guaranteed ≥99% purity.

## How Does O-304 Work?

### Direct AMPK Activation
- **β1 subunit binding** - Allosteric activation
- **Kinase activation** - Phosphorylation cascade
- **Energy sensing** - Metabolic regulation

### Metabolic Effects
- **Glucose uptake** - GLUT4 translocation
- **Fatty acid oxidation** - Lipid metabolism
- **Mitochondrial biogenesis** - Energy production
- **Insulin sensitivity** - Glucose handling

### Downstream Pathways
