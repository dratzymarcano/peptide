faqs: 
- question: "What is HGH Fragment 176-191?"
answer: "HGH Fragment 176-191 is a peptide comprising amino acids 176-191 of human growth hormone. This C-terminal region is associated with lipolytic activity without the full hormone's growth-promoting effects."
- question: "How is it different from AOD-9604?"
answer: "AOD-9604 is HGH Fragment 176-191 with an added tyrosine residue at the N-terminus. This modification may enhance stability and activity. Both target fat metabolism."
- question: "What is HGH Fragment 176-191 used for in research?"
answer: "It's used to study the lipolytic region of growth hormone, investigating fat metabolism, adipocyte function, and lipid mobilisation without IGF-1 or glucose effects."
- question: "How should it be stored?"
answer: "Store lyophilised at -20°C. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 3-4 weeks."
- question: "What purity is your HGH Fragment 176-191?"
answer: "Our HGH Fragment 176-191 is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC with mass spectrometry identity confirmation."
- question: "Does it affect IGF-1?"
answer: "Research indicates HGH Fragment 176-191 does not stimulate IGF-1 production, unlike full growth hormone. This enables isolated fat metabolism studies."
- question: "How do I reconstitute it?"
answer: "Reconstitute in sterile bacteriostatic water. Add solvent slowly and gently swirl to dissolve."
- question: "What sizes are available?"
answer: "HGH Fragment 176-191 is available in 2mg and 5mg vials."

## What is HGH Fragment 176-191?

**HGH Fragment 176-191** is a synthetic Пептид comprising the C-terminal portion of human growth hormone (amino acids 176-191). This specific region has been identified as responsible for GH's lipolytic (fat-burning) activity without the hormone's growth-promoting effects.

By isolating this fragment, researchers can Исследование GH's fat metabolism effects independently of IGF-1 elevation, glucose effects, and tissue growth, providing a cleaner tool for adipose biology research.

Пептид Shop supplies **research-grade HGH Fragment 176-191** with guaranteed ≥99% purity.

## How Does HGH Fragment 176-191 Work?

### Lipolytic Activity
- **Fat breakdown stimulation** - Triglyceride hydrolysis
- **Beta-adrenergic enhancement** - Lipolytic signalling
- **HSL activation** - Hormone-sensitive lipase effects
- **FFA mobilisation** - Fatty acid release

### Selective Action
- **No IGF-1 elevation** - Unlike full GH
- **No glucose effects** - Preserved insulin sensitivity
- **No growth promotion** - Isolated metabolic effects

## Research Applications

### Fat Metabolism
- **Lipolysis mechanisms** - Fat breakdown pathways
- **Adipocyte biology** - Fat cell function
- **GH fragment comparisons** - AOD-9604 vs HGH Frag
