faqs:
- question: "What is CJC-1295 No DAC used for in research?"
  answer: "CJC-1295 No DAC (Modified GRF 1-29) is used to study GHRH receptor activation and pulsatile growth hormone release. It's a modified GHRH analog with enhanced stability for research applications."
- question: "What is the difference between CJC-1295 with and without DAC?"
  answer: "CJC-1295 without DAC (Mod GRF 1-29) has a shorter half-life and produces pulsatile GH release. CJC-1295 with DAC has Drug Affinity Complex for extended duration, producing sustained GH elevation."
- question: "How does Mod GRF 1-29 work?"
  answer: "It binds to GHRH receptors on pituitary somatotropes, stimulating cAMP production and GH release. The modifications at positions 2, 8, 15, and 27 provide enhanced stability."
- question: "How should CJC-1295 No DAC be stored?"
  answer: "Store lyophilised at -20°C. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 2-3 weeks. The modifications improve but don't eliminate degradation."
- question: "What purity is your CJC-1295 No DAC?"
  answer: "Our CJC-1295 No DAC is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis with purity and mass spectrometry data."
- question: "Can it be combined with GHRPs?"
  answer: "Yes, researchers often study Mod GRF 1-29 with GHRPs like Ipamorelin or GHRP-6 to investigate GHRH-GHRP synergy. Both peptide types are available from Peptide Shop."
- question: "How do I reconstitute it?"
  answer: "Reconstitute in sterile bacteriostatic water. Add solvent slowly along the vial wall and gently swirl to dissolve."
- question: "What sizes are available?"
  answer: "CJC-1295 No DAC is available in 2mg and 5mg vials."

## What is CJC-1295 No DAC?

**CJC-1295 No DAC** (also known as Modified GRF 1-29 or Mod GRF) is a synthetic analog of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) with specific amino acid modifications that enhance its stability and Период полураспада. Unlike CJC-1295 with DAC, this version lacks the Drug Affinity Complex, producing pulsatile rather than sustained GH release patterns.

The Пептид represents the first 29 amino acids of GHRH with modifications at positions 2, 8, 15, and 27 to improve resistance to enzymatic degradation. These modifications make it a more practical research tool while maintaining GHRH receptor binding activity.

Пептид Shop supplies **research-grade CJC-1295 No DAC** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis.

## How Does CJC-1295 No DAC Work?

### GHRH Receptor Activation
The Пептид binds to GHRH receptors on pituitary somatotropes:
- **Gs protein coupling** - Receptor-mediated signalling
- **cAMP elevation** - Adenylyl cyclase activation
- **PKA activation** - Downstream kinase cascade
- **GH gene expression** - Enhanced transcription
- **GH release** - Stimulated exocytosis

### Modified Stability
Key substitutions provide enhanced stability:
- **Position 2** - D-Ala substitution
- **Position 8** - Gln to Ala
- **Position 15** - Gly to Ala
- **Position 27** - Met to Leu or Nle

### Pulsatile vs Sustained Release
Without DAC, the Пептид produces:
- **Shorter Период полураспада** - Minutes rather than days
- **Pulsatile GH patterns** - Mimics physiology
- **GHRP synergy** - Enhanced when combined

## Research Applications

### GH Axis Studies
- **GHRH signalling** - Receptor pharmacology
- **Pituitary function** - Somatotrope biology
- **GH pulsatility** - Secretion pattern research
- **Feedback mechanisms** - Regulatory studies

### Combination Research
- **GHRP synergy** - Enhanced GH release
- **Ipamorelin combinations** - Popular paradigm
- **GHRP-6 studies** - Comparative research
