faqs:
- question: "What is bacteriostatic water?"
  answer: "Bacteriostatic water is sterile water containing 0.9% benzyl alcohol, which inhibits bacterial growth. It's used to reconstitute lyophilized peptides for multi-use applications."
- question: "Why use bacteriostatic water instead of sterile water?"
  answer: "Bacteriostatic water contains benzyl alcohol which prevents bacterial contamination after opening. This allows multiple withdrawals from a vial over several weeks, unlike single-use sterile water."
- question: "How long can reconstituted peptides be stored?"
  answer: "Peptides reconstituted with bacteriostatic water can typically be stored at 2-8°C for 2-4 weeks. Always follow the specific guidance for each peptide."
- question: "Is your bacteriostatic water pharmaceutical grade?"
  answer: "Yes, our bacteriostatic water meets USP (United States Pharmacopeia) standards for sterility, purity, and benzyl alcohol concentration."
- question: "How much bacteriostatic water do I need per peptide vial?"
  answer: "Typically 1-2ml per peptide vial is recommended. The exact amount depends on your desired concentration. Each 10ml vial can reconstitute 5-10 peptide vials."
- question: "Can bacteriostatic water be frozen?"
  answer: "Freezing is not recommended as it may affect sterility and cause the vial to crack. Store at room temperature (15-25°C) away from direct light."
- question: "How long does bacteriostatic water last unopened?"
  answer: "Unopened bacteriostatic water has a shelf life of 2 years when stored properly. Once opened, use within 28 days."
- question: "What size syringe should I use?"
  answer: "We recommend using insulin syringes with a 29-31 gauge needle for accurate measurement. Always use a new sterile syringe for each withdrawal."

# Bacteriostatic Вода for Пептид Research

## What is Bacteriostatic Вода?

Bacteriostatic Вода (BAC Вода) is Стерильный Вода containing 0.9% benzyl alcohol, a bacteriostatic preservative that inhibits the growth of bacteria. This makes it ideal for reconstituting лиофилизированный (freeze-dried) Пептидs for research applications where multiple withdrawals from the same vial are needed.

## Key Features

### USP Grade Quality
Our bacteriostatic Вода meets United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for:
- Sterility
- Purity  
- Benzyl alcohol concentration (0.9%)
- Endotoxin levels

### Multi-Use Design
Unlike single-use Стерильный Вода, bacteriostatic Вода allows multiple withdrawals over several weeks without contamination risk, making it cost-effective for research laboratories.

### Convenient 10ml Size
Each 10ml vial can reconstitute 5-10 Пептид vials depending on concentration requirements.

## How to Use Bacteriostatic Вода

### Reconstitution Steps
1. Allow the Пептид vial to reach room temperature
2. Clean both vial tops with an alcohol swab
3. Using a Стерильный syringe, withdraw the desired amount of bacteriostatic Вода
4. Insert the needle into the Пептид vial, aiming at the glass wall
5. Slowly inject the Вода, allowing it to run down the vial wall
6. Gently swirl (do not shake) until fully dissolved
7. Store восстановленный Пептид at 2-8°C

### Recommended Volumes
| Пептид Amount | Suggested BAC Вода | Concentration |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 5mg | 1.0ml | 5mg/ml |
| 5mg | 2.0ml | 2.5mg/ml |
| 10mg | 2.0ml | 5mg/ml |
| 10mg | 4.0ml | 2.5mg/ml |

## Storage Instructions

- **Unopened**: Store at room temperature (15-25°C), away from direct light
- **Opened**: Use within 28 days
- **Do not freeze**: Freezing may compromise sterility
- **Shelf life**: 2 years from manufacture date

## Applications in Research

Bacteriostatic Вода is essential for:
- Пептид reconstitution for in vitro studies
- Preparation of stock Растворs
- Multi-day research Протоколs requiring repeat sampling
- Any application where sterility must be maintained over time

## Comparison: Bacteriostatic vs Стерильный Вода

| Feature | Bacteriostatic Вода | Стерильный Вода |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| Preservative | 0.9% Benzyl Alcohol | None |
| Multiple Uses | Yes (up to 28 days) | Single use only |
| Bacterial Growth | Inhibited | Possible after opening |
| Best For | Multi-dose Пептидs | Single-dose applications |

## Quality Assurance

Every batch of our bacteriostatic Вода undergoes testing for:
- **Sterility**: Tested per USP <71>
- **Endotoxins**: Tested per USP <85>
- **Particulate Matter**: Tested per USP <788>
- **Benzyl Alcohol Content**: Verified at 0.9% ± 0.05%
