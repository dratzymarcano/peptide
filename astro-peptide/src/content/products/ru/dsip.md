faqs:
- question: "What is DSIP used for in research?"
  answer: "DSIP is studied for its effects on sleep regulation, circadian rhythms, stress response, and neuroendocrine function. It was originally isolated from rabbit brain."
- question: "How does DSIP work?"
  answer: "DSIP appears to modulate multiple receptor systems and influence the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Its exact mechanisms continue to be investigated."
- question: "What is the origin of DSIP?"
  answer: "DSIP was first isolated in 1977 from rabbit brain during sleep studies. It's a nonapeptide found in various tissues."
- question: "How should DSIP be stored?"
  answer: "Store lyophilised DSIP at -20°C. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 3-4 weeks."
- question: "What purity is your DSIP?"
  answer: "Our DSIP is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis."
- question: "Does DSIP affect cortisol?"
  answer: "Research suggests DSIP may modulate stress hormone levels, including potential effects on cortisol and ACTH."
- question: "How do I reconstitute DSIP?"
  answer: "Reconstitute in sterile bacteriostatic water. Add solvent slowly and gently swirl to dissolve."
- question: "What sizes are available?"
  answer: "DSIP is available in 2mg and 5mg vials."

## What is DSIP?

**DSIP** (Delta Sleep-Inducing Пептид) is a nonaПептид first isolated from rabbit brain in 1977 during research into sleep physiology. The Пептид was named for its ability to promote delta wave sleep patterns in research models.

Beyond sleep regulation, DSIP has demonstrated effects on stress response, pain perception, and neuroendocrine function, making it a versatile tool for neuroscience research.

Пептид Shop supplies **research-grade DSIP** with guaranteed ≥99% purity.

## How Does DSIP Work?

### Sleep Regulation
- **Delta wave promotion** - Deep sleep patterns
- **Circadian effects** - Rhythm modulation
- **Sleep architecture** - Stage regulation

### Neuroendocrine
- **HPA axis effects** - Stress response
- **Cortisol modulation** - Hormone balance
- **LH/FSH effects** - Reproductive hormones

### Other Effects
- **Analgesic properties** - Pain modulation
- **Antioxidant** - Protective effects
- **Stress adaptation** - Resilience

## Research Applications

### Sleep Research
- **Insomnia models** - Sleep improvement
- **Circadian rhythm** - Timing studies
- **Sleep disorders** - Dysfunction research

### Stress Research
- **HPA axis** - Stress response
- **Adaptation** - Resilience mechanisms
