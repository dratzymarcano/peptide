## What is BPC-157?

**BPC-157** (Body Protection Compound-157) is a synthetic pentadecaПептид (15 amino acids) derived from a protein found in human gastric juice. Since its discovery, BPC-157 has become one of the most extensively studied Пептидs in tissue healing and regeneration research. For published research, see [PubMed studies on BPC-157](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=BPC-157){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

The Пептид's name reflects its origin—a body protection compound identified for its remarkable cytoprotective and regenerative properties across multiple tissue types including tendons, ligaments, muscles, and gastrointestinal epithelium.

Пептид Shop supplies **research-grade BPC-157** with guaranteed ≥99% purity and full analytical documentation.
