faqs:
- question: "What is GHRP-6 used for in research?"
  answer: "GHRP-6 is used to study growth hormone secretion, ghrelin receptor activation, appetite regulation, and metabolic effects. It's one of the original synthetic GH secretagogues with well-characterised pharmacology."
- question: "How is GHRP-6 different from GHRP-2?"
  answer: "GHRP-6 has stronger appetite-stimulating effects and may cause more cortisol/prolactin release than GHRP-2. GHRP-2 is considered more selective. Both are valuable for different research questions."
- question: "Does GHRP-6 affect appetite in research models?"
  answer: "Yes, GHRP-6 is known to stimulate appetite in research models through ghrelin receptor activation. This property is useful for studying ghrelin's orexigenic effects."
- question: "How should GHRP-6 be stored?"
  answer: "Store lyophilised GHRP-6 at -20°C. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 4 weeks."
- question: "What purity is your GHRP-6?"
  answer: "Our GHRP-6 is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis."
- question: "What is the mechanism of action?"
  answer: "GHRP-6 binds to GHS-R (ghrelin receptors) on pituitary somatotropes, stimulating GH release. It also suppresses somatostatin tone."
- question: "Can it be combined with GHRH analogs?"
  answer: "Yes, GHRP-6 with GHRH analogs like CJC-1295 is a common research combination to study synergistic GH release."
- question: "What sizes are available?"
  answer: "GHRP-6 is available in 5mg and 10mg vials."

## What is GHRP-6?

**GHRP-6** (Growth Hormone Releasing Пептид-6) is a synthetic hexaПептид that stimulates growth hormone release through activation of the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a). As one of the first synthetic GH secretagogues developed, GHRP-6 has extensive research documentation and remains a valuable tool for Исследованиеing growth hormone physiology.

Unlike more selective Пептидs such as ipamorelin, GHRP-6 also stimulates appetite and affects cortisol and prolactin levels, making it useful for Исследованиеing the full spectrum of ghrelin receptor effects.

Пептид Shop supplies **research-grade GHRP-6** with guaranteed ≥99% purity.

## How Does GHRP-6 Work?

### GHS-R Activation
- **Ghrelin receptor binding** - Primary mechanism
- **GH release** - Pituitary somatotrope stimulation
- **Somatostatin suppression** - Reduced inhibitory tone
- **GHRH synergy** - Enhanced combined effects

### Secondary Effects
- **Appetite stimulation** - Ghrelin-like orexigenic effects
- **Cortisol release** - Moderate elevation
- **Prolactin effects** - Some increase observed

## Research Applications

### GH Axis Studies
- **GH secretion** - Release mechanisms
- **Ghrelin pharmacology** - Receptor characterisation
- **Pituitary function** - Somatotrope biology

### Appetite Research
- **Orexigenic effects** - Food intake studies
- **Ghrelin mimetics** - Comparative research
