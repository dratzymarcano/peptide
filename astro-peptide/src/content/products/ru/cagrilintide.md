faqs:
- question: "What is Cagrilintide used for in research?"
  answer: "Cagrilintide is used in metabolic research to study amylin receptor signalling, appetite regulation, gastric emptying, and glucagon suppression. It provides a long-acting tool for investigating amylin's role in energy homeostasis."
- question: "How is Cagrilintide different from pramlintide?"
  answer: "Cagrilintide is a long-acting amylin analog with an acylated fatty acid side chain enabling weekly research dosing, while pramlintide requires more frequent administration. This extended duration enables different experimental paradigms."
- question: "What is amylin's role in metabolism?"
  answer: "Amylin is co-secreted with insulin from pancreatic beta cells. It slows gastric emptying, suppresses glucagon secretion, and promotes satiety through central nervous system actions. Cagrilintide enables research into these pathways."
- question: "How should Cagrilintide be stored?"
  answer: "Store lyophilised Cagrilintide at -20°C. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 3 weeks. The fatty acid modification provides good stability but standard peptide handling applies."
- question: "What purity is your Cagrilintide?"
  answer: "Our Cagrilintide is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis with purity data and mass spectrometry identity confirmation."
- question: "How do I reconstitute Cagrilintide?"
  answer: "Reconstitute in sterile bacteriostatic water or appropriate buffer. Add solvent slowly and gently swirl to dissolve. Avoid shaking."
- question: "Can Cagrilintide be studied with GLP-1 agonists?"
  answer: "Yes, research often investigates cagrilintide in combination with semaglutide (the 'CagriSema' approach) to study complementary satiety mechanisms. Both peptides are available from Peptide Shop."
- question: "What sizes are available?"
  answer: "Cagrilintide is available in 2mg and 5mg vials suitable for various research scales."

## What is Cagrilintide?

**Cagrilintide** (AM833, NN9838) is a long-acting acylated analog of human amylin, a Пептид hormone co-secreted with insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Through fatty acid acylation, cagrilintide achieves an extended Период полураспада enabling once-weekly research dosing, making it an invaluable tool for Исследованиеing amylin's role in satiety and metabolic regulation.

Amylin complements insulin's glucose-lowering effects through distinct mechanisms including gastric emptying delay, glucagon suppression, and central satiety signalling. Cagrilintide provides researchers with a stable, long-acting tool to investigate these pathways in extended experimental paradigms.

Пептид Shop supplies **research-grade Cagrilintide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis.

## How Does Cagrilintide Work?

Cagrilintide activates amylin receptors (AMY1, AMY2, AMY3), which are complexes of the calcitonin receptor with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs).

### Satiety Signalling

Central effects include:
- **Area postrema activation** - Key brainstem satiety centre
- **Meal size reduction** - Promoting earlier termination of eating
- **Palatability effects** - Modifying food preference in models
- **Hypothalamic signalling** - Complementing leptin pathways

### Gastric Effects

Peripheral actions include:
- **Gastric emptying delay** - Prolonging nutrient absorption
- **Glucagon suppression** - Reducing hepatic glucose output
- **Postprandial glucose control** - Smoothing glycemic excursions

### Combination Research

Cagrilintide is often studied with GLP-1 agonists:
- **Complementary mechanisms** - Different satiety pathways
- **Enhanced efficacy** - Potentially additive effects
- **CagriSema research** - Combined with semaglutide
