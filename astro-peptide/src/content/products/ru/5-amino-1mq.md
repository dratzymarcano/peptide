faqs: 
- question: "What forms of 5-Amino-1MQ are available?"
answer: "We offer 5-Amino-1MQ in two convenient forms: Oral Capsules (50mg per capsule) for precise dosing convenience, and High-Purity Powder (99%) for flexible research applications. Both forms maintain the same exceptional purity standards."
- question: "What is 5-Amino-1MQ used for in research?"
answer: "5-Amino-1MQ is used to study nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) inhibition and its effects on cellular metabolism, NAD+ levels, energy expenditure, and adipose tissue function. It's a key tool for metabolic ageing and obesity research."
- question: "What is NNMT and why is its inhibition researched?"
answer: "NNMT is an enzyme that methylates nicotinamide, consuming SAM (S-adenosylmethionine). High NNMT activity is associated with obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Inhibition may preserve NAD+ precursors and improve metabolic function."
- question: "How does 5-Amino-1MQ affect NAD+ metabolism?"
answer: "By inhibiting NNMT, 5-Amino-1MQ may preserve nicotinamide for NAD+ synthesis rather than methylation. This research application connects to NAD+ biology and cellular energy metabolism."
- question: "How should 5-Amino-1MQ be stored?"
answer: "Store at room temperature, protected from light and moisture. Both capsule and powder forms are stable at ambient conditions when kept dry. Capsules should be kept in their original container."
- question: "What purity is your 5-Amino-1MQ?"
answer: "Our 5-Amino-1MQ is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC. Both capsule and powder forms meet this purity standard. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis with purity and identity data."
- question: "What is the difference between capsules and powder?"
answer: "Oral Capsules (50mg) offer precise, pre-measured doses ideal for consistent research protocols. High-Purity Powder (99%) provides flexibility for custom concentration preparation and larger-scale studies."
- question: "What is the minimum order requirement?"
answer: "A minimum purchase of £200 is required for 5-Amino-1MQ orders. This applies to any combination of capsules or powder forms."

## What is 5-Amino-1MQ?

**5-Amino-1MQ** (5-Amino-1-Methylquinolinium) is a selective inhibitor of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), an enzyme increasingly recognised as a key regulator of cellular metabolism, NAD+ homeostasis, and adipose tissue function. This research compound has emerged as an important tool for Исследованиеing the intersection of epigenetics, energy metabolism, and ageing.

NNMT catalyses the N-methylation of nicotinamide (a NAD+ precursor) using SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) as a methyl donor. By inhibiting this enzyme, 5-Amino-1MQ enables researchers to investigate how NNMT modulation affects cellular metabolism, NAD+ availability, and metabolic health.

Пептид Shop supplies **research-grade 5-Amino-1MQ** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC analysis.

## How Does 5-Amino-1MQ Work?

5-Amino-1MQ inhibits NNMT, affecting multiple metabolic pathways:

### NAD+ Metabolism
- **Nicotinamide preservation** - Less substrate consumed by NNMT
- **NAD+ precursor availability** - More nicotinamide for salvage pathway
- **Cellular energy** - Potential effects on mitochondrial function
- **Sirtuin activity** - NAD+-dependent deacetylase regulation

### Methylation Balance
- **SAM conservation** - Reduced consumption by NNMT
- **Methylation capacity** - Effects on other methyltransferases
- **Epigenetic regulation** - Downstream effects on gene expression

### Adipose Tissue
- **NNMT is highly expressed in fat** - Key research target
- **Adipocyte metabolism** - Effects on lipid handling
- **Obesity research** - Understanding NNMT's role
