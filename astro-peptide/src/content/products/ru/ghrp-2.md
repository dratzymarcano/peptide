FAQs:
  - question: "What is GHRP-2 used for in research?"
    answer: "GHRP-2 is used to study Гормон роста secretion, ghrelin receptor activation, and somatotrope function. It's considered more selective than GHRP-6 with less appetite stimulation."
  - question: "How is GHRP-2 different from GHRP-6?"
    answer: "GHRP-2 is more selective for GH release with less appetite stimulation and lower cortisol/prolactin effects than GHRP-6, making it useful for studying isolated GH secretion."
  - question: "What is another name for GHRP-2?"
    answer: "GHRP-2 is also known as Pralmorelin and was one of the first synthetic GH secretagogues studied clinically for GH deficiency research."
  - question: "How should GHRP-2 be stored?"
    answer: "Store lyophilised GHRP-2 at -20°C. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 4 weeks."
  - question: "What Чистота is your GHRP-2?"
    answer: "Our GHRP-2 is ≥99% pure as verified by ВЭЖХ. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis."
  - question: "Can it be combined with GHRH analogs?"
    answer: "Yes, GHRP-2 with GHRH analogs is a common research combination for studying synergistic GH release mechanisms."
  - question: "How do I reconstitute GHRP-2?"
    answer: "Reconstitute in sterile bacteriostatic water. Add solvent slowly and gently swirl to dissolve."
  - question: "What sizes are available?"
    answer: "GHRP-2 is available in 5mg and 10mg vials."

## What is GHRP-2?

**GHRP-2** (Гормон роста Releasing Peptide-2, Pralmorelin) is a synthetic hexapeptide that stimulates Гормон роста release through activation of the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a). GHRP-2 is considered more selective than GHRP-6, producing robust GH release with less pronounced effects on appetite, cortisol, and prolactin.

The peptide's improved selectivity profile makes it valuable for studying GH secretion mechanisms without confounding orexigenic effects.

Peptide Магазин supplies **research-grade GHRP-2** with guaranteed ≥99% Чистота.

## How Does GHRP-2 Work?

### GHS-R Activation
- **Ghrelin receptor binding** - Primary mechanism
- **Selective GH release** - Enhanced specificity vs GHRP-6
- **Somatostatin suppression** - Reduced inhibitory tone
- **GHRH synergy** - Enhanced combined effects

### Selectivity Profile
- **Minimal appetite effects** - Less orexigenic than GHRP-6
- **Lower cortisol impact** - Improved hormonal profile
- **Reduced prolactin** - Cleaner research tool

## Research Applications

### GH Axis Studies
- **GH secretion** - Release mechanisms
- **GHRP comparisons** - Selectivity research
- **Pituitary function** - Somatotrope biology
