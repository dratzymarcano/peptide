FAQs:
  - question: "What is Tesofensine used for in research?"
    answer: "Tesofensine is used in neuroscience and obesity research to study triple monoamine reuptake inhibition. It blocks reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, enabling research into appetite regulation and energy expenditure mechanisms."
  - question: "How does Tesofensine differ from traditional appetite suppressants?"
    answer: "Tesofensine inhibits reuptake of three neurotransmitters (NE, DA, 5-HT) rather than primarily affecting one system. This triple mechanism enables research into complex monoaminergic appetite regulation."
  - question: "What was Tesofensine originally developed for?"
    answer: "Tesofensine was initially developed as a potential Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease treatment. Похудение observed in trials led to obesity research applications."
  - question: "How should Tesofensine be stored?"
    answer: "Store Tesofensine at room temperature, protected from light and moisture. Unlike Пептиды, it doesn't require cold Хранение. Keep in a cool, dry place."
  - question: "What Чистота is your Tesofensine?"
    answer: "Our Tesofensine is ≥99% pure as verified by ВЭЖХ analysis. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis with Чистота and identity confirmation."
  - question: "What is the mechanism of action?"
    answer: "Tesofensine inhibits presynaptic reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, increasing synaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters to affect appetite, satiety, and energy expenditure."
  - question: "How do I prepare Tesofensine for research?"
    answer: "Tesofensine can be dissolved in DMSO or appropriate organic solvents for in vitro research. Consult literature for specific research application protocols."
  - question: "What sizes are available?"
    answer: "Tesofensine is available in 10mg and 25mg sizes for various research scales."

## What is Tesofensine?

**Tesofensine** (NS2330) is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor that blocks the presynaptic reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. Originally developed for neurodegenerative disease research, tesofensine has become an important tool for studying the neurological basis of appetite regulation and energy Главнаяostasis.

Unlike single-target compounds, tesofensine's triple mechanism enables researchers to investigate the complex interplay between monoaminergic systems in controlling food intake and metabolic rate. This makes it valuable for understanding the neuropharmacology of obesity and appetite disorders.

Peptide Магазин supplies **research-grade Tesofensine** with guaranteed ≥99% Чистота, verified through comprehensive ВЭЖХ analysis.

## How Does Tesofensine Work?

Tesofensine increases synaptic concentrations of three key neurotransmitters:

### Norepinephrine Effects
- **Sympathetic activation** - Increased metabolic rate
- **Appetite suppression** - Reduced hunger signalling
- **Energy expenditure** - Enhanced thermogenesis
- **Lipolysis promotion** - Fat mobilisation effects

### Dopamine Effects
- **Reward pathway modulation** - Altered food reward
- **Motivation effects** - Changes in food-seeking behaviour
- **Satiety enhancement** - Earlier meal termination
- **Hedonic eating** - Reduced pleasure-driven consumption

### Serotonin Effects
- **Satiety signalling** - Enhanced fullness perception
- **Mood effects** - Emotional eating modulation
- **Carbohydrate preference** - Altered macronutrient choices

## Research Applications

### Obesity Research
- **Appetite mechanisms** - Understanding hunger/satiety
- **Energy balance** - Metabolic rate studies
- **Feeding behaviour** - Food choice research

### Neuroscience
- **Monoamine systems** - Reuptake inhibition studies
- **Receptor pharmacology** - Transporter research
- **Behavioural neuroscience** - Motivation and reward
