FAQs:
  - question: "What is NAD+ used for in research?"
    answer: "NAD+ is studied for cellular energy metabolism, sirtuin activation, DNA repair, mitochondrial function, and longevity mechanisms."
  - question: "How does NAD+ work?"
    answer: "NAD+ is essential for redox reactions, serving as an electron carrier in metabolism. It also activates sirtuins and PARPs involved in cellular repair."
  - question: "What are sirtuins?"
    answer: "Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent enzymes that regulate metabolism, stress response, and ageing. Seven sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are found in mammals."
  - question: "How should NAD+ be stored?"
    answer: "Store lyophilised NAD+ at -20°C. Reconstituted solutions should be kept at 2-8°C and used promptly due to stability concerns."
  - question: "What Чистота is your NAD+?"
    answer: "Our NAD+ is ≥99% pure as verified by ВЭЖХ. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis."
  - question: "Why do NAD+ levels decline with age?"
    answer: "NAD+ declines due to reduced synthesis and increased consumption by repair enzymes. This decline is associated with age-related changes."
  - question: "How do I reconstitute NAD+?"
    answer: "Reconstitute in sterile water. Use freshly prepared solutions for best results."
  - question: "What sizes are available?"
    answer: "NAD+ is available in 100mg, 500mg, and 1g quantities."

## What is NAD+?

**NAD+** (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a coenzyme found in all living cells that plays fundamental roles in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cellular signalling. NAD+ is essential for hundreds of enzymatic reactions and is a key regulator of cellular health.

Interest in NAD+ has surged due to its central role in ageing research, particularly its relationship with sirtuins and cellular repair mechanisms. NAD+ levels naturally decline with age, driving research into maintaining cellular NAD+ pools.

Peptide Магазин supplies **research-grade NAD+** with guaranteed ≥99% Чистота.
