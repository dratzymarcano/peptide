# Buy TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4) for Research

**TB-500** is a synthetic version of the naturally occurring peptide Thymosin Beta-4. It is ubiquitous in both human and animal cells. This product is sold exclusively for **laboratory research and in-vitro use**. It is strictly prohibited for human use.

## Research Context

Thymosin Beta-4 plays a vital role in the regulation of actin polymerization, a fundamental process in cell structure and motility. TB-500 is widely used in research models to study cell migration and tissue regeneration mechanisms.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Actin Sequestration:** TB-500 binds to monomeric actin (G-actin), preventing polymerization into filaments. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining the pool of available actin monomers in cells.
*   **Cell Migration:** Research indicates that Thymosin Beta-4 promotes the migration of endothelial cells and keratinocytes, which is a key component of wound healing models.
*   **Anti-Inflammatory Pathways:** Studies have observed the peptide's influence on downregulating inflammatory cytokines in various tissue models.
*   **Cardiac Research:** *In-vivo* animal studies have explored the potential of Thymosin Beta-4 to promote cardiomyocyte survival and migration following ischemic injury.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Ac-Ser-DKP-Asp-Lys-Pro-Asp-Leu-Ala-Glu-Ile-Lys-Phe-Asp-Lys-Ser-Lys-Leu-Lys-Lys-Thr-Glu-Thr-Gln-Glu-Lys-N
*   **Molecular Formula:** C212H350N56O78S
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C. Stable for up to 2 years.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C. Use within 1 week. For longer storage, aliquot and freeze at -20°C.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).
*   **Endotoxin:** Tested to ensure suitability for cell culture applications.

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Can this be used for injury recovery in athletes?**
A: No. This product is for research purposes only. Any use in humans, including athletes, is strictly prohibited and may violate WADA regulations.

**Q: What is the difference between TB-500 and Thymosin Beta-4?**
A: In the research reagent market, "TB-500" is often used as a synonym for the synthetic sequence of Thymosin Beta-4. However, strictly speaking, TB-500 refers to a specific fragment (17-23) in some contexts, while the full length is Thymosin Beta-4. Our product is the full sequence unless otherwise noted in the COA.

**Q: Is this product sterile?**
A: The lyophilized powder is processed in a clean environment but is not certified as a sterile pharmaceutical product. It should be filtered (0.22 µm) if used in sterile cell culture.
