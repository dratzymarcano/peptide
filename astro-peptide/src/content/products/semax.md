# Buy Semax for Research

**Semax** is a synthetic heptapeptide that is an analogue of the ACTH(4-10) fragment. It was designed to prolong the biological activity of the native fragment. **For laboratory research use only.**

## Research Context

Semax is extensively studied for its neurogenic and neuroprotective effects. It is often used in research models of ischemic stroke and cognitive decline.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Cognitive Enhancement:** Studies in rodents demonstrate improved learning and memory retention following Semax administration.
*   **Neuroprotection:** Research suggests Semax can protect neurons from oxidative stress and glutamate toxicity.
*   **Gene Expression:** It has been shown to alter the expression of genes related to the immune system and vascular system in the brain.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro
*   **Molecular Formula:** C37H51N9O10S
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Is this the same as ACTH?**
A: No. It is a fragment of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) that lacks hormonal activity (does not stimulate cortisol) but retains neuroactive properties.

**Q: What is the shelf life?**
A: Lyophilized powder is stable for 2 years at -20°C.
