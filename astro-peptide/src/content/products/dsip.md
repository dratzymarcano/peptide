# Buy DSIP for Research

**DSIP** (Delta Sleep Inducing Peptide) is a nonapeptide that was originally isolated from the cerebral venous blood of rabbits in a state of induced sleep. **For laboratory research use only.**

## Research Context

DSIP is a neuromodulator that has been studied for decades regarding its involvement in sleep regulation, specifically delta (slow-wave) sleep.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Sleep Architecture:** Studies in various mammals to determine if administration promotes the onset of slow-wave sleep.
*   **Stress & Cortisol:** Research suggests DSIP may play a role in the regulation of ACTH and cortisol levels, potentially modulating the stress response.
*   **Analgesia:** Some animal studies have explored potential pain-relieving properties.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Trp-Ala-Gly-Gly-Asp-Ala-Ser-Gly-Glu
*   **Molecular Formula:** C35H48N10O15
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Is this a sleeping pill?**
A: No. DSIP is a research chemical. Its effects on human sleep are complex and not fully understood. It is not approved for treating insomnia.

**Q: Does it cross the blood-brain barrier?**
A: Research indicates that DSIP can cross the blood-brain barrier, though the transport mechanism is a subject of ongoing study.
