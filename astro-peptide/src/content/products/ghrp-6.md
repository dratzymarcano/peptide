# Buy GHRP-6 for Research

**GHRP-6** is a synthetic hexapeptide that stimulates the release of growth hormone. It was one of the first GHRPs developed. **For laboratory research use only.**

## Research Context

GHRP-6 is distinct for its strong affinity for the ghrelin receptor, leading to significant appetite stimulation in addition to GH release.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Appetite Regulation:** Extensively used in studies of hunger signaling and gastric motility due to its potent orexigenic effect.
*   **Cytoprotection:** Research suggests GHRP-6 may have protective effects on cardiac and gastric tissue independent of GH release.
*   **Growth Hormone Axis:** Used to study the feedback loops of the HPA axis.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** His-D-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2
*   **Molecular Formula:** C46H56N12O6
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Does it cause hunger?**
A: In animal models, GHRP-6 administration is reliably associated with increased food intake.

**Q: Is it specific to GH?**
A: It can also stimulate ACTH and cortisol release at higher doses in research settings.
