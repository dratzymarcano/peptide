# Buy GHRP-2 for Research

**GHRP-2** (Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide-2), also known as Pralmorelin, is a synthetic hexapeptide. It acts as an agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). **For laboratory research use only.**

## Research Context

GHRP-2 is one of the most potent members of the GHRP family. It is widely used in research to stimulate the release of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **GH Secretion:** Studies demonstrate significant increases in plasma growth hormone levels following administration in animal models.
*   **Appetite Stimulation:** While less potent than GHRP-6, GHRP-2 still exhibits some orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) effects in research subjects.
*   **Catabolic States:** Investigated for its potential to reverse catabolic states and improve lean body mass in rodent models of disease.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** D-Ala-D-2-Nal-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2
*   **Molecular Formula:** C45H55N9O6
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: How does it compare to Ipamorelin?**
A: GHRP-2 is generally considered more potent in stimulating GH release but may also stimulate slight increases in cortisol and prolactin, whereas Ipamorelin is more selective.

**Q: Is it stable in solution?**
A: Once reconstituted, it should be used within a few weeks and kept refrigerated.
