faqs:
  - question: "What is AOD-9604 used for in research?"
    answer: "AOD-9604 is used primarily in fat metabolism and lipolysis research. Scientists study its effects on adipocyte function, lipid mobilisation, and metabolic regulation without the IGF-1 elevating effects of full growth hormone."
  - question: "How is AOD-9604 different from HGH Fragment 176-191?"
    answer: "AOD-9604 is the modified form of HGH Fragment 176-191 with a tyrosine residue added. This modification may enhance stability and activity. Both target the same lipolytic region of growth hormone without affecting blood glucose."
  - question: "How should AOD-9604 be stored?"
    answer: "Store lyophilised AOD-9604 at -20°C for optimal long-term stability. Once reconstituted, keep refrigerated at 2-8°C and use within 3-4 weeks. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles."
  - question: "What purity is your AOD-9604?"
    answer: "Our AOD-9604 is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC analysis. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis with purity data, mass spectrometry identity confirmation, and peptide content analysis."
  - question: "Does AOD-9604 affect IGF-1 levels in research models?"
    answer: "Research indicates AOD-9604 retains lipolytic activity without stimulating IGF-1 production, distinguishing it from full growth hormone. This makes it valuable for studying isolated fat metabolism effects."
  - question: "How do I reconstitute AOD-9604?"
    answer: "Reconstitute AOD-9604 in sterile bacteriostatic water. Add solvent slowly along the vial wall and gently swirl. Common research concentrations are 1-2 mg/mL."
  - question: "What is the mechanism of action?"
    answer: "AOD-9604 represents the fat-reducing region of human growth hormone (amino acids 177-191). It stimulates lipolysis and inhibits lipogenesis in adipose tissue without affecting glucose metabolism."
  - question: "What sizes are available?"
    answer: "AOD-9604 is available in 2mg and 5mg vials. The 2mg size is ideal for pilot studies while 5mg suits larger research projects."

## What is AOD-9604?

**AOD-9604** (Anti-Obesity Drug 9604) is a modified fragment of human growth hormone comprising amino acids 177-191 of the C-terminal region, with an additional tyrosine residue at the N-terminus. This synthetic peptide was specifically designed to isolate the fat-metabolising properties of growth hormone without its growth-promoting or diabetogenic effects.

Originally developed by Metabolic Pharmaceuticals in Australia, AOD-9604 represents one of the most targeted approaches to studying growth hormone's lipolytic activity. By using only the fat-reducing portion of the full hormone, researchers can investigate adipose tissue metabolism without confounding effects on IGF-1 or glucose homeostasis.

Peptide Shop supplies **research-grade AOD-9604** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis, ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.

## How Does AOD-9604 Work?

AOD-9604's mechanism of action centres on its ability to stimulate lipolysis and inhibit lipogenesis in adipose tissue, mimicking a specific subset of growth hormone's metabolic effects.

### Lipolytic Activity

The peptide promotes fat breakdown through:
- **Beta-3 adrenergic receptor interaction** - Research suggests enhancement of lipolytic signalling
- **cAMP pathway activation** - Increased intracellular signalling in adipocytes
- **Hormone-sensitive lipase activation** - Enhanced triglyceride breakdown
- **Free fatty acid release** - Mobilisation of stored fat for oxidation

### Anti-Lipogenic Effects

AOD-9604 also inhibits fat accumulation:
- **Reduced lipogenesis** - Decreased conversion of glucose to stored fat
- **Adipocyte differentiation effects** - Research on fat cell maturation
- **Metabolic enzyme modulation** - Effects on key lipid synthesis pathways

### Selective Action

A key research advantage is its selectivity:
- **No IGF-1 elevation** - Unlike full growth hormone
- **No glucose effects** - Preserved insulin sensitivity in research models
- **No growth promotion** - Isolated metabolic effects
- **Targeted adipose action** - Focus on fat tissue metabolism

## Research Applications of AOD-9604

### Fat Metabolism Studies

Primary research applications include:
- **Lipolysis mechanisms** - Understanding fat breakdown pathways
- **Lipogenesis inhibition** - Studying fat storage prevention
- **Adipocyte biology** - Effects on fat cell function
- **Comparative GH studies** - Fragment vs full hormone effects

### Obesity Research

The peptide enables focused weight studies:
- **Body composition effects** - Fat mass changes in models
- **Visceral fat targeting** - Research on abdominal fat
- **Energy balance** - Effects on metabolic homeostasis
- **Combination approaches** - Synergy with other interventions

### Metabolic Research

Broader metabolic applications:
- **Insulin sensitivity** - Studies confirming preserved glucose handling
- **Lipid profiles** - Effects on circulating lipids
- **Thermogenesis** - Potential energy expenditure effects
