# Buy Semaglutide for Research

**Semaglutide** is a modified analogue of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1). It features a C-18 fatty diacid chain attached to Lys-26, which promotes binding to albumin and significantly extends its half-life. **Sold exclusively for laboratory research.**

## Research Context

Semaglutide is a primary tool in metabolic research, particularly for studying type 2 diabetes and obesity. Its mechanism involves activating the GLP-1 receptor, which enhances insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon secretion.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Insulin Secretion:** Studies on beta-cell function and glucose-dependent insulin release.
*   **Weight Loss Mechanisms:** Research into the central regulation of appetite and gastric emptying rates in obese mouse models.
*   **Neuroprotection:** Emerging research investigates the potential neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 agonists in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Modified GLP-1 sequence.
*   **Molecular Formula:** C187H291N45O59
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water (pH > 7.0 recommended).
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C. Avoid agitation.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥99% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Is this Ozempic/Wegovy?**
A: No. "Ozempic" and "Wegovy" are brand names for prescription medications. Our product is the raw research chemical Semaglutide, intended for laboratory use only and not for medical treatment.

**Q: How do I dissolve it?**
A: Semaglutide can be difficult to dissolve in pure water due to its isoelectric point. A slightly alkaline buffer (pH 7.4-8.0) is often recommended for research solutions.
