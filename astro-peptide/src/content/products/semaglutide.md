faqs:
  - question: "What is Semaglutide used for in research?"
    answer: "Semaglutide is primarily used in metabolic research to study GLP-1 receptor activation, glucose-dependent insulin secretion, appetite regulation, and weight management mechanisms. Research applications include investigating beta-cell function, gastric emptying rates, and potential neuroprotective properties in disease models."
  - question: "How should I store Semaglutide peptide?"
    answer: "Lyophilised Semaglutide should be stored at -20°C for long-term stability. Once reconstituted, store at 2-8°C (refrigerator) and use within 4 weeks. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles and protect from light. Always store in airtight containers to prevent moisture absorption."
  - question: "What purity is your Semaglutide?"
    answer: "Our Semaglutide is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC analysis. Each batch comes with a Certificate of Analysis (COA) confirming purity, identity via mass spectrometry, and peptide content. We maintain strict quality control throughout manufacturing and shipping."
  - question: "How do I reconstitute Semaglutide for research?"
    answer: "Reconstitute Semaglutide in sterile bacteriostatic water or a slightly alkaline buffer (pH 7.4-8.0). Semaglutide can be difficult to dissolve in pure water near its isoelectric point. Gently swirl the vial rather than shaking vigorously to prevent peptide degradation."
  - question: "Is this the same as Ozempic or Wegovy?"
    answer: "No. Ozempic and Wegovy are brand-name prescription medications containing semaglutide as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Our product is the raw research-grade peptide sold exclusively for laboratory research purposes, not for human consumption or medical treatment."
  - question: "What is the half-life of Semaglutide?"
    answer: "Semaglutide has an extended half-life of approximately 7 days due to its C-18 fatty diacid modification that promotes albumin binding. This prolonged half-life makes it particularly valuable for studying sustained GLP-1 receptor activation in research models."
  - question: "Do you ship Semaglutide internationally?"
    answer: "We primarily offer fast UK delivery with next-day and standard shipping options. For international shipping enquiries, please contact our customer service team to discuss options and regulations for your specific country."
  - question: "What package sizes are available?"
    answer: "Semaglutide is available in 2mg, 5mg, and 10mg vials to suit various research needs and budgets. Larger quantities are available for institutional research projects - contact us for bulk pricing and custom orders."

## What is Semaglutide?

**Semaglutide** is a synthetic analogue of human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone naturally produced in the intestines that plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and appetite regulation. This research peptide has gained significant attention in scientific communities worldwide for its applications in metabolic research, particularly in studies related to type 2 diabetes and obesity. For comprehensive background information, see the [PubChem compound entry for Semaglutide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Semaglutide){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

The molecular structure of Semaglutide features a unique C-18 fatty diacid chain attached to the lysine residue at position 26. This structural modification enables the peptide to bind to serum albumin, dramatically extending its biological half-life to approximately seven days. This prolonged activity profile makes Semaglutide an invaluable tool for researchers studying sustained GLP-1 receptor activation mechanisms.

Peptide Shop supplies **research-grade Semaglutide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified by HPLC analysis and mass spectrometry. Every order includes a comprehensive Certificate of Analysis (COA), ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.

## How Does Semaglutide Work?

Semaglutide exerts its biological effects through high-affinity binding to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in various tissues including pancreatic beta cells, the central nervous system, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. Upon receptor binding, Semaglutide initiates several downstream signalling cascades that researchers continue to investigate.

### Pancreatic Effects

In pancreatic beta cells, GLP-1 receptor activation by Semaglutide triggers glucose-dependent insulin secretion through the cAMP-PKA signalling pathway. This glucose-dependent mechanism is particularly noteworthy in research, as it suggests reduced risk of hypoglycaemia compared to insulin secretagogues that work independently of glucose levels.

Research has demonstrated that Semaglutide may also promote beta-cell proliferation and reduce apoptosis in preclinical models, suggesting potential applications in studying beta-cell preservation strategies.

### Central Nervous System Actions

Semaglutide crosses the blood-brain barrier and activates GLP-1 receptors in key hypothalamic regions involved in appetite regulation, including the arcuate nucleus and paraventricular nucleus. Research indicates that this central action contributes to reduced food intake and altered food preferences in animal models.

Emerging research also explores Semaglutide's potential neuroprotective properties, with studies investigating its effects in models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke.

### Gastrointestinal Effects

GLP-1 receptor activation slows gastric emptying, which may contribute to prolonged satiety and reduced postprandial glucose excursions. Researchers studying gut-brain axis signalling find Semaglutide particularly useful for investigating these gastrointestinal regulatory mechanisms.

## Research Applications of Semaglutide

### Metabolic Research

Semaglutide is extensively used in metabolic research laboratories studying:

- **Glucose homeostasis mechanisms** - Understanding how GLP-1 receptor activation influences blood glucose regulation
- **Insulin secretion dynamics** - Investigating the molecular pathways governing glucose-dependent insulin release
- **Beta-cell biology** - Studying potential regenerative and protective effects on pancreatic beta cells
- **Glucagon suppression** - Researching the relationship between GLP-1 signalling and alpha-cell function

### Weight Management Studies

The peptide's effects on body weight have made it crucial for obesity research, including studies on:

- **Appetite regulation** - Investigating central mechanisms controlling food intake and satiety
- **Energy expenditure** - Studying metabolic rate changes associated with GLP-1 receptor activation
- **Food preference alteration** - Researching how GLP-1 signalling affects dietary choices in animal models
- **Adipose tissue biology** - Understanding effects on fat storage and metabolism

### Cardiovascular Research

Emerging evidence suggests GLP-1 receptor agonists may have cardiovascular effects beyond glucose control, leading to research investigating:

- **Endothelial function** - Studying vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties
- **Cardiac metabolism** - Investigating effects on myocardial glucose and fatty acid utilisation
- **Atherosclerosis progression** - Researching potential anti-atherogenic mechanisms

### Neuroscience Applications

The presence of GLP-1 receptors in the brain has sparked significant neuroscience research using Semaglutide:

- **Neurodegeneration models** - Investigating potential protective effects in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models
- **Stroke recovery** - Studying effects on neuronal survival and functional recovery
- **Cognitive function** - Researching impacts on learning and memory in animal models

## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines

### Reconstitution Protocol

For optimal results in research applications, follow these reconstitution guidelines:

1. **Allow the vial to reach room temperature** before opening to prevent moisture condensation on the lyophilised peptide
2. **Calculate the required concentration** for your research application
3. **Use sterile bacteriostatic water** or a slightly alkaline buffer (pH 7.4-8.0) as the reconstitution vehicle
4. **Add the solvent slowly** along the vial wall, not directly onto the peptide
5. **Gently swirl the vial** to dissolve - never shake vigorously as this may cause peptide degradation
6. **Ensure complete dissolution** before aliquoting for experiments

### Storage Recommendations
