# Buy CJC-1295 No DAC (Mod GRF 1-29)

**CJC-1295 No DAC**, often referred to as **Mod GRF 1-29**, is a synthetic analogue of the endogenous Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH). It is modified to extend its half-life in plasma. **Sold for laboratory research use only.**

## Research Context

Native GHRH (1-29) has a very short half-life (minutes) due to rapid enzymatic degradation by DPP-IV. CJC-1295 No DAC incorporates four amino acid substitutions that protect it from this cleavage, making it a valuable tool for studying sustained GH release.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Pulsatile GH Release:** Used to mimic the body's natural pulsatile secretion of growth hormone in animal studies.
*   **Synergy Studies:** Often researched in combination with GHRPs (like Ipamorelin) to study synergistic effects on pituitary somatotrophs.
*   **Sleep Research:** Investigated for its effects on slow-wave sleep patterns in rodent models.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Tyr-D-Ala-Asp-Ala-Ile-Phe-Thr-Gln-Ser-Tyr-Arg-Kv-Leu-Ala-Gln-Leu-Sark-Ala-Arg-Lys-Leu-Leu-Gln-Asp-Ile-Leu-Sark-Arg-NH2 (Substitutions applied)
*   **Molecular Formula:** C152H252N44O42
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C. Use within 1-2 weeks.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: What is the difference between "DAC" and "No DAC"?**
A: "DAC" stands for Drug Affinity Complex. CJC-1295 *with* DAC binds to albumin, extending its half-life to days. "No DAC" (this product) has a half-life of roughly 30 minutes, which is ideal for mimicking natural pulsatile release in research.

**Q: Is this product suitable for human injection?**
A: No. It is a research chemical not approved for human use.
