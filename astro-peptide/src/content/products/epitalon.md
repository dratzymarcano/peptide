# Buy Epitalon for Research

**Epitalon** (also known as Epithalon) is a synthetic tetrapeptide (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) derived from epithalamin, a peptide found in the pineal gland. **For laboratory research use only.**

## Research Context

Epitalon is primarily known in the research community for its potential to induce telomerase activity, the enzyme responsible for maintaining telomere length.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Telomere Biology:** *In-vitro* studies on human somatic cells to observe the effects of Epitalon on telomere elongation and cell senescence.
*   **Circadian Rhythms:** Research into its role in regulating melatonin secretion and normalizing circadian rhythms in elderly animal models.
*   **Antioxidant Activity:** Investigated for its ability to inhibit free radical formation.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly
*   **Molecular Formula:** C14H22N4O9
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Does this extend life?**
A: While animal studies have shown lifespan extension in certain species (e.g., fruit flies, mice), these results have not been clinically validated in humans. This product is for research use only.

**Q: Is it orally active?**
A: Some research suggests bioavailability via mucosal absorption, but most laboratory studies utilize injection for precise dosing.
