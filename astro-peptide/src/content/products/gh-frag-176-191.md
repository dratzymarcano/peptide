# Buy GH Frag 176-191 for Research

**GH Frag 176-191** is a modified fragment of the C-terminal region of Human Growth Hormone (hGH). **For laboratory research use only.**

## Research Context

This fragment is isolated to study the lipolytic (fat-burning) properties of GH without the diabetogenic (blood sugar raising) effects associated with the full-length hormone.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Lipolysis:** *In-vitro* studies on adipocytes (fat cells) to measure the release of free fatty acids.
*   **Inhibition of Lipogenesis:** Research into its ability to prevent the formation of new fat deposits.
*   **Metabolic Safety:** Studies comparing its effect on insulin sensitivity versus full-length hGH.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Tyr-Leu-Arg-Ile-Val-Gln-Cys-Arg-Ser-Vla-Glu-Gly-Ser-Cys-Gly-Phe
*   **Molecular Formula:** C78H125N23O23S2
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Does it affect IGF-1 levels?**
A: Research suggests that unlike full-length GH, this fragment does not significantly increase IGF-1 levels.

**Q: Is it the same as AOD-9604?**
A: They are very similar. AOD-9604 is a modified version of the 177-191 fragment with a tyrosine added to the N-terminus for stability.
