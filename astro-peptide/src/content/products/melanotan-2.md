faqs:
  - question: "What is Melanotan 2 used for in research?"
    answer: "Melanotan 2 is primarily used in melanocortin receptor research, studying melanogenesis (skin pigmentation), appetite regulation, sexual function, and energy homeostasis. It's a non-selective agonist of melanocortin receptors MC1, MC3, MC4, and MC5."
  - question: "What is the difference between Melanotan 1 and Melanotan 2?"
    answer: "Melanotan 1 (afamelanotide) is a linear peptide that selectively targets MC1 receptors for pigmentation research. Melanotan 2 is a cyclic peptide that non-selectively activates multiple melanocortin receptors, making it useful for broader research applications including appetite and sexual function studies."
  - question: "How should Melanotan 2 be stored?"
    answer: "Store lyophilised Melanotan 2 at -20°C for long-term stability. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 4 weeks. The cyclic structure provides good stability, but protect from light and avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles."
  - question: "What purity is your Melanotan 2?"
    answer: "Our Melanotan 2 is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC analysis. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis with purity data, mass spectrometry identity confirmation, and peptide content analysis."
  - question: "How do I reconstitute Melanotan 2?"
    answer: "Reconstitute Melanotan 2 in sterile bacteriostatic water. Add solvent slowly along the vial wall and gently swirl to dissolve. MT-2 dissolves readily in water. Common research concentrations range from 1-2 mg/mL."
  - question: "What are melanocortin receptors?"
    answer: "Melanocortin receptors (MC1R-MC5R) are G protein-coupled receptors that regulate various physiological processes including pigmentation, appetite, inflammation, and sexual function. Melanotan 2 activates multiple receptor subtypes, making it valuable for diverse research applications."
  - question: "Is Melanotan 2 stable in solution?"
    answer: "MT-2 has good stability due to its cyclic lactam structure. Reconstituted peptide should be stored refrigerated (2-8°C) and used within 4 weeks. For longer storage, prepare aliquots and freeze at -20°C."
  - question: "What sizes are available?"
    answer: "Melanotan 2 is available in 10mg and 20mg vials. These sizes are suitable for various research scales. Bulk quantities are available for institutional research - contact us for pricing."

## What is Melanotan 2?

**Melanotan 2** (MT-2, MT-II) is a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide analogue of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). Originally developed at the University of Arizona in the 1980s, this research peptide has become an essential tool for studying melanocortin receptor signalling and the regulation of skin pigmentation.

The peptide's cyclic lactam structure provides enhanced stability and receptor binding affinity compared to linear α-MSH analogues. Melanotan 2 acts as a non-selective agonist at melanocortin receptors MC1, MC3, MC4, and MC5, enabling researchers to study diverse physiological processes beyond pigmentation.

Peptide Shop supplies **research-grade Melanotan 2** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis, ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.

## How Does Melanotan 2 Work?

Melanotan 2 exerts its biological effects through activation of melanocortin receptors, a family of G protein-coupled receptors that regulate diverse physiological processes. Understanding these mechanisms is central to ongoing research in dermatology, endocrinology, and neuroscience.

### Melanocortin Receptor Family

MT-2 activates multiple melanocortin receptor subtypes:

- **MC1R** - Primarily expressed in melanocytes; regulates skin pigmentation
- **MC3R** - Expressed in hypothalamus and peripheral tissues; involved in energy homeostasis
- **MC4R** - Central nervous system expression; regulates appetite and sexual function
- **MC5R** - Sebaceous glands and other tissues; less well characterised

### Melanogenesis Pathway

The primary research application involves studying skin pigmentation:

- **MC1R activation** - Triggers intracellular cAMP production in melanocytes
- **MITF activation** - Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor upregulation
- **Tyrosinase expression** - Key enzyme in melanin synthesis pathway
- **Eumelanin production** - Brown-black pigment providing UV protection
- **Melanosome transfer** - Distribution of pigment to keratinocytes

### Central Nervous System Effects

MT-2's non-selective receptor profile enables diverse CNS research:

- **Appetite regulation** - MC4R activation in hypothalamus suppresses food intake
- **Energy expenditure** - Effects on metabolic rate through central mechanisms
- **Sexual behaviour** - Research on erectile function and libido in animal models
- **Anxiolytic effects** - Studies on stress and anxiety-related behaviours

### Anti-Inflammatory Research

Emerging research explores melanocortin anti-inflammatory properties:

- **Cytokine modulation** - Effects on inflammatory mediator production
- **Immune cell function** - Research on macrophage and lymphocyte behaviour
- **Tissue protection** - Studies on inflammation-related damage

## Research Applications of Melanotan 2

### Pigmentation Research

Melanotan 2 is extensively used in dermatological research:

- **Melanogenesis mechanisms** - Understanding pigment production pathways
- **UV protection** - Research on natural photoprotection
- **Vitiligo models** - Studies on repigmentation strategies
- **Melanoma biology** - Understanding MC1R role in melanocyte transformation
- **Skin ageing** - Research on photoprotection and pigmentary changes

### Appetite and Obesity Research

MC4R activation makes MT-2 valuable for metabolic studies:

- **Food intake regulation** - Investigating central appetite control mechanisms
- **Satiety signalling** - Research on post-prandial fullness pathways
- **Energy homeostasis** - Studies on metabolic regulation
- **Obesity models** - Investigating potential intervention targets

### Sexual Function Studies

Research into melanocortin effects on sexual behaviour:

- **Erectile function** - Studies on central arousal mechanisms
- **Female sexual function** - Research on desire and response pathways
- **Receptor pharmacology** - Understanding MC4R role in sexual behaviour

### Inflammatory Disease Models

Anti-inflammatory properties are actively investigated:

- **Arthritis models** - Research on joint inflammation
- **Inflammatory bowel disease** - Studies on gut inflammation
- **Neuroinflammation** - Research on brain inflammatory conditions
- **Tissue repair** - Investigating healing in inflammatory contexts

### Skin Disorder Research

Dermatological applications extend beyond pigmentation:

- **Photoprotection mechanisms** - Understanding skin UV defence
- **Skin barrier function** - Research on epidermal integrity
- **Wound healing** - Studies on melanocyte contribution to repair

| **CAS Number** | 121062-08-6 |
| **Molecular Formula** | C₅₀H₆₉N₁₅O₉ |
| **Molecular Weight** | 1024.2 g/mol |
| **Sequence** | Ac-Nle-cyclo[Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-NH₂ |
| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |
| **Appearance** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |
| **Solubility** | Freely soluble in water |
| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |

## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines

### Reconstitution Protocol

Melanotan 2 is straightforward to prepare for research use:

1. **Allow vial to reach room temperature** before opening
2. **Calculate desired concentration** - common range is 1-2 mg/mL
3. **Add sterile bacteriostatic water** slowly along the vial wall
4. **Gently swirl to dissolve** - MT-2 dissolves readily
5. **Protect from light** - MT-2 can degrade under prolonged light exposure
6. **Prepare aliquots** if storing long-term

### Storage Recommendations

| Condition | Temperature | Duration |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 36 months |
| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | Up to 4 weeks |
| **Frozen aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 6 months |

**Stability note:** The cyclic lactam structure provides excellent stability compared to linear peptides. However, protect from light and use standard peptide handling practices.
