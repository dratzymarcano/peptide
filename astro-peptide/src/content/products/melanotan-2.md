# Buy Melanotan 2 (MT-2) for Research

**Melanotan 2** is a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide lactam analog of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). It is a non-selective agonist of the melanocortin receptors. **For in-vitro and laboratory research use only.**

## Research Context

Melanotan 2 was originally developed to investigate the regulation of skin pigmentation (melanogenesis) but has since been studied for its effects on feeding behavior, energy homeostasis, and sexual function in animal models.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Melanogenesis:** Stimulates MC1 receptors to increase the production of eumelanin. Used in studies of UV protection mechanisms.
*   **Sexual Function:** Investigated for its ability to induce penile erection in rats via central nervous system melanocortin receptors.
*   **Appetite Regulation:** Studies show MT-2 can suppress food intake in rodents through activation of MC3 and MC4 receptors in the hypothalamus.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Ac-Nle-c[Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-NH2
*   **Molecular Formula:** C50H69N15O9
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C. Use within 2-3 weeks.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Is this product safe for tanning?**
A: This product is sold strictly for research purposes. It is not a cosmetic and is not approved for use as a tanning agent in humans. Side effects in clinical trials have included nausea and hypertension.

**Q: How is it synthesized?**
A: It is synthesized via solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and cyclized to improve stability and potency.
