# Buy BPC-157 Peptide for Research

**BPC-157** (Body Protection Compound-157) is a synthetic pentadecapeptide composed of 15 amino acids. It is derived from a protective protein found in the stomach. This product is strictly for **in-vitro and laboratory research use only**. It is not intended for human or animal diagnostic, therapeutic, or clinical use.

## Research Context

BPC-157 has been the subject of numerous *in-vitro* and animal model studies investigating its potential role in tissue repair and cytoprotection. Research literature suggests that the peptide may influence various growth factors involved in angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) and fibroblast migration.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Angiogenesis:** Studies have explored the peptide's interaction with the VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) pathway in tissue culture models.
*   **Tendon and Ligament Fibroblasts:** *In-vitro* assays have been used to observe the effects of BPC-157 on fibroblast proliferation and migration speeds.
*   **Gastric Epithelial Cells:** Original isolation of the parent protein from gastric juice has led to extensive research into its cytoprotective properties in gastric epithelial cell lines.
*   **Nitric Oxide System:** Some research indicates an interaction with the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway, which is crucial for endothelial cell function.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Gly-EPP-Pro-Pro-Ala-Asp-Asp-Ala-Gly-Leu-Val
*   **Molecular Formula:** C62H98N16O22
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water and acetic acid.
*   **Appearance:** White to off-white lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

This peptide is supplied as a lyophilized powder. For optimal stability, please adhere to the following research-grade storage guidelines:

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C. Stable for up to 2 years.
*   **Reconstituted:** Once reconstituted with bacteriostatic water or sterile saline, the solution should be stored at 4°C and used within 2-3 weeks. For longer storage, aliquot and freeze at -20°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.

## Quality Assurance

We provide a Certificate of Analysis (COA) with every batch, verifying:
*   **Purity:** ≥98% via High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Confirmed via Mass Spectrometry (MS).
*   **Net Peptide Content:** Verified to ensure accurate research dosing calculations.

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Is this BPC-157 suitable for human use?**
A: No. This product is a chemical reagent intended strictly for laboratory research and development. It is not approved for human consumption, injection, or therapeutic use.

**Q: How should I dissolve the peptide for cell culture?**
A: BPC-157 is generally soluble in sterile water or PBS. However, solubility can vary based on concentration. We recommend performing a solubility test with a small sample before preparing large stock solutions.

**Q: Do you ship to the US?**
A: We ship to approved research institutions globally, subject to local import regulations. Please check your local customs requirements for research peptides.

**Q: What is the counter-ion for this peptide?**
A: Unless otherwise specified, our peptides are typically acetate salts. TFA salts are available upon custom request for specific analytical applications.
