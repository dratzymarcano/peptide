# Buy O-304 (ATX-304) for Research

**O-304** (also known as ATX-304) is a novel small molecule AMPK activator. While often categorized with peptides in research catalogs, it is a pan-AMPK activator. **For laboratory research use only.**

## Research Context

AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. O-304 is used to study the effects of AMPK activation on glucose uptake and lipid oxidation.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Metabolic Syndrome:** Studies in rodent models of type 2 diabetes and obesity.
*   **Endurance:** Research into the "exercise mimetic" effects of AMPK activation.
*   **Cardiovascular Health:** Investigated for potential benefits in microvascular perfusion.

## Chemical Properties

*   **Solubility:** Soluble in DMSO.
*   **Appearance:** White to off-white powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Storage:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Handling:** Protect from light and moisture.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Is this a peptide?**
A: Technically it is a small molecule, but it is frequently studied alongside metabolic peptides like GLP-1 agonists.

**Q: How is it administered in mice?**
A: Typically via oral gavage in research studies due to its oral bioavailability profile in animals.
