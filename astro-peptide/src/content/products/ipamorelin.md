# Buy Ipamorelin for Research

**Ipamorelin** is a synthetic pentapeptide and a selective agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R1a). It is widely used in research to study growth hormone pulsatility without the side effects associated with other secretagogues. **Strictly for in-vitro and animal research use.**

## Research Context

Ipamorelin is unique among GHRPs (Growth Hormone Releasing Peptides) for its high selectivity. It stimulates the release of growth hormone but, unlike GHRP-2 or GHRP-6, does not significantly stimulate the release of cortisol, prolactin, or ACTH in research models.

### Key Areas of Investigation

*   **Growth Hormone Secretion:** Studies focus on the dose-dependent release of GH from the pituitary gland in animal models.
*   **Bone Growth:** Research in rodent models has investigated the effects of Ipamorelin on longitudinal bone growth rate and bone mineral density.
*   **Gastric Motility:** Unlike other ghrelin mimetics, Ipamorelin shows less impact on gastric emptying, making it a specific tool for isolating GH effects.
*   **Catabolic States:** Investigated for potential utility in reversing nitrogen wasting in catabolic states induced by disease or surgery (animal models).

## Chemical Properties

*   **Sequence:** Aib-His-D-2-Nal-D-Phe-Lys-NH2
*   **Molecular Formula:** C38H49N9O5
*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water and saline.
*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.

## Handling and Storage

*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C. Stable for approximately 14 days.

## Quality Assurance

*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).
*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).
*   **Solubility Test:** Clear solution in water.

## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)

**Q: Does Ipamorelin increase hunger in test subjects?**
A: Research indicates that Ipamorelin has a much weaker effect on appetite stimulation compared to GHRP-6, likely due to its specific binding profile.

**Q: Is this a steroid?**
A: No, it is a peptide (a short chain of amino acids). It is not an anabolic steroid, though it influences the growth hormone axis.

**Q: Can this be used for anti-aging therapy?**
A: We supply this product strictly for laboratory research. We do not support or condone its use for anti-aging or any other human therapeutic application.
