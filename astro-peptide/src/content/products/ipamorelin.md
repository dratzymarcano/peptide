faqs:
  - question: "What is Ipamorelin used for in research?"
    answer: "Ipamorelin is used to study growth hormone secretion, ghrelin receptor (GHS-R) activation, and somatotrope cell function. It's valued for its selectivity, causing minimal effects on cortisol and prolactin compared to other GHRPs."
  - question: "How is Ipamorelin different from other GHRPs?"
    answer: "Ipamorelin is highly selective for GH release with minimal effects on cortisol, prolactin, and appetite. This makes it valuable for studying isolated GH secretion mechanisms without confounding hormonal effects."
  - question: "What is the mechanism of action?"
    answer: "Ipamorelin acts as a ghrelin mimetic, binding to growth hormone secretagogue receptors (GHS-R) in the pituitary to stimulate GH release. It works synergistically with GHRH in research models."
  - question: "How should Ipamorelin be stored?"
    answer: "Store lyophilised Ipamorelin at -20°C for long-term stability. Once reconstituted, keep at 2-8°C and use within 4 weeks. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles."
  - question: "What purity is your Ipamorelin?"
    answer: "Our Ipamorelin is ≥99% pure as verified by HPLC. Each batch includes a Certificate of Analysis with purity data and mass spectrometry identity confirmation."
  - question: "Can Ipamorelin be studied with CJC-1295?"
    answer: "Yes, researchers often study ipamorelin combined with CJC-1295 to investigate GHRP-GHRH synergy. Both peptides are available from Peptide Shop."
  - question: "How do I reconstitute Ipamorelin?"
    answer: "Reconstitute in sterile bacteriostatic water. Add solvent slowly along the vial wall and gently swirl to dissolve. Ipamorelin dissolves readily in water."
  - question: "What sizes are available?"
    answer: "Ipamorelin is available in 2mg and 5mg vials for various research scales."

## What is Ipamorelin?

**Ipamorelin** is a synthetic pentapeptide growth hormone secretagogue that selectively stimulates growth hormone (GH) release from pituitary somatotrope cells. Distinguished by its high selectivity, ipamorelin causes minimal effects on cortisol and prolactin levels, making it an invaluable research tool for studying isolated GH secretion mechanisms.

Developed as a ghrelin receptor (GHS-R) agonist, ipamorelin represents one of the most selective GH releasing peptides (GHRPs) available for research. Its clean pharmacological profile enables researchers to study GH axis physiology without the confounding effects seen with less selective compounds.

Peptide Shop supplies **research-grade Ipamorelin** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis.

## How Does Ipamorelin Work?

Ipamorelin activates growth hormone secretagogue receptors (GHS-R) in the anterior pituitary, triggering GH release through multiple mechanisms.

### Receptor Activation
- **GHS-R binding** - High-affinity ghrelin receptor agonism
- **Calcium signalling** - Intracellular Ca²⁺ elevation in somatotropes
- **cAMP pathway** - Secondary signalling cascade activation
- **GH exocytosis** - Stimulated hormone granule release

### Selectivity Profile
Ipamorelin's research value lies in its selectivity:
- **Minimal cortisol effects** - Unlike GHRP-6
- **Minimal prolactin effects** - Clean hormonal profile
- **No appetite stimulation** - Unlike ghrelin itself
- **Dose-dependent GH release** - Predictable research tool

### Synergy with GHRH
Research often combines ipamorelin with GHRH analogs:
- **Complementary mechanisms** - Different receptor targets
- **Enhanced GH release** - Synergistic effects
- **CJC-1295 combinations** - Popular research paradigm

## Research Applications

### Pituitary Function
- **Somatotrope biology** - GH-producing cell research
- **GH secretion dynamics** - Pulsatile release studies
- **Receptor pharmacology** - GHS-R characterisation

### GH Axis Research
- **IGF-1 pathways** - Downstream signalling
- **GH feedback** - Regulatory mechanism studies
- **Age-related changes** - Somatopause research

### Metabolic Studies
- **Body composition** - GH effects on tissues
- **Lipid metabolism** - Fat utilisation pathways
- **Protein synthesis** - Anabolic mechanism research
