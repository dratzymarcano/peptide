## Why Proper Peptide Storage Matters

Peptides like BPC-157 are sensitive molecules that can degrade when exposed to heat, moisture, light, or oxygen. Proper storage is essential to maintain the purity and activity of your research compounds.

Following these guidelines will help ensure your peptides remain stable throughout your research project.

## Storing Lyophilised (Freeze-Dried) Peptides

Lyophilised peptides are the most stable form for storage. Here's how to keep them in optimal condition:

### Temperature Guidelines

- **Short-term (weeks)**: Store at -20°C
- **Long-term (months to years)**: Store at -80°C for maximum stability
- **Avoid**: Repeated freeze-thaw cycles

### Environmental Protection

- Keep peptides in original sealed vials until ready for use
- Store in a dark location away from direct light
- Maintain low humidity environment
- Use desiccants if necessary

## Reconstituting BPC-157 and Other Peptides

When preparing peptides for research use:

### Step-by-Step Reconstitution

1. **Allow to reach room temperature**: Remove vial from freezer and let equilibrate for 10-15 minutes
2. **Choose appropriate solvent**: Bacteriostatic water is ideal for multi-use scenarios
3. **Add solvent slowly**: Direct the stream along the vial wall, not directly onto the peptide cake
4. **Mix gently**: Roll the vial between your palms rather than shaking vigorously
5. **Verify dissolution**: Solution should be clear with no visible particles

### Recommended Solvents

| Peptide Type | Primary Solvent | Alternative |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| BPC-157 | Bacteriostatic water | Sterile saline |
| TB-500 | Bacteriostatic water | Sterile water |
| Most peptides | Bacteriostatic water | — |

## Storage After Reconstitution

Once reconstituted, peptide solutions are less stable:

- **Temperature**: Store at 2-8°C (standard refrigerator)
- **Duration**: Use within 4-6 weeks for optimal activity
- **Container**: Keep in original sterile vial with rubber septum
- **Access**: Use fresh, sterile needles for each withdrawal

## Signs of Peptide Degradation

Monitor your peptide solutions for these indicators of degradation:

- **Cloudiness**: Clear solutions becoming turbid
- **Precipitates**: Visible particles or flakes
- **Color change**: Most peptides should remain colorless
- **Reduced activity**: Inconsistent research results

## BPC-157 Specific Considerations

BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound-157) has some unique characteristics:

- Relatively stable compared to many peptides
- Soluble in aqueous solutions at research concentrations
- Standard storage protocols apply
- 15 amino acid sequence provides good stability

## Quality Assurance

At Peptide Shop, every batch of BPC-157 includes:

- Certificate of Analysis (COA)
- HPLC chromatogram showing ≥99% purity
- Mass spectrometry confirmation
- Batch-specific documentation

## Conclusion

Proper storage and handling are essential for maintaining peptide integrity in research. By following these best practices, you can ensure reliable, reproducible results in your studies with BPC-157 and other research peptides.
