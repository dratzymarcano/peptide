      faqs:
        - question: "What are peptides?"
          answer: "Peptides are short chains of amino acids, typically containing between 2 and 50 amino acids. They are the building blocks of proteins and play crucial roles in various biological processes. Research peptides are synthetic versions used for scientific study and laboratory research."
        - question: "Are your products safe for human consumption?"
          answer: "Our research peptides are strictly for laboratory and research use only - they are NOT intended for human consumption. All products are clearly labeled for their intended purpose. Researchers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations."
        - question: "Who can purchase from Peptide Shop?"
          answer: "Our products are available to researchers, laboratories, academic institutions, and qualified individuals conducting legitimate research. By placing an order, you confirm that products will be used solely for research purposes."
        - question: "Do I need a license to purchase research peptides?"
          answer: "Requirements vary by country and jurisdiction. In most European countries, research peptides can be purchased without a special license for legitimate research purposes. However, we recommend checking your local regulations before ordering."
        - question: "What makes Peptide Shop different from other suppliers?"
          answer: "We offer 98%+ purity guaranteed on all peptides, verified by HPLC and Mass Spectrometry analysis. Every order includes a Certificate of Analysis (COA), we provide same-day dispatch before 4PM, and we offer secure payment options including Bitcoin."
        - question: "Do you have a physical location?"
          answer: "We operate primarily online to keep costs low and pass savings to our customers. Our products are stored in climate-controlled facilities and shipped directly to ensure maximum freshness and potency."

      faqs:
        - question: "What is the purity of your peptides?"
          answer: "We guarantee a minimum purity of 98% for all research peptides, with many products exceeding 99% purity. Every batch is tested using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and verified through Mass Spectrometry analysis."
        - question: "Do you provide Certificates of Analysis (COA)?"
          answer: "Yes, every order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis (COA) showing the HPLC purity results, molecular weight verification, and batch information. COAs are also available for download on each product page."
        - question: "How do you test your peptides?"
          answer: "All peptides undergo rigorous quality control including: HPLC analysis for purity verification, Mass Spectrometry (MS) for molecular weight confirmation, appearance inspection, and solubility testing. Only batches meeting our strict standards are released for sale."
        - question: "What does HPLC purity mean?"
          answer: "HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) purity indicates the percentage of the target peptide in the sample. A 98% HPLC purity means that 98% of the sample consists of the intended peptide, with minimal impurities or degradation products."
        - question: "Are your peptides pharmaceutical grade?"
          answer: "Our peptides are research-grade with pharmaceutical-level purity (≥98%). They are synthesized using the same methods as pharmaceutical peptides but are intended for research purposes only, not therapeutic use."
        - question: "How do you ensure batch-to-batch consistency?"
          answer: "We work with ISO-certified manufacturers who follow strict GMP-like protocols. Each batch is independently tested, and we maintain detailed records to ensure consistent quality across all production runs."
