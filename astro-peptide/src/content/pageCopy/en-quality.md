  title: "Quality Assurance"
  subtitle: "In scientific research, data integrity depends on reagent integrity. We implement rigorous quality control to ensure every vial meets the highest standards."
  description: "Our commitment to purity. Learn about our HPLC and Mass Spectrometry testing protocols for research peptides."
  hplcTitle: "HPLC Analysis"
  hplcDescription: "High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) determines peptide purity. We guarantee minimum 99% purity for all catalog items, ensuring impurities like deletion sequences or incomplete synthesis byproducts are minimized."
  purityStandard: "Purity Standard"
  msTitle: "Mass Spectrometry"
  msDescription: "Mass Spectrometry (MS) verifies molecular weight and peptide identity. This confirms the amino acid sequence is correct and matches the theoretical mass."
  molecularConfirmation: "Molecular Confirmation"
  verified: "100% Verified"
  coaTitle: "Certificate of Analysis (COA)"
  coaDescription: "Transparency is key. A Certificate of Analysis is available for every batch we produce. Download the COA directly from the product page before purchase."
