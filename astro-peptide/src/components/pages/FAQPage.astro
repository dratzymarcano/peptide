        question: "What are peptides?",
        answer: "Peptides are short chains of amino acids, typically containing between 2 and 50 amino acids. They are the building blocks of proteins and play crucial roles in various biological processes. Research peptides are synthetic versions used for scientific study and laboratory research."
      },
      {
        question: "Are your products safe for human consumption?",
        answer: "Our research peptides are strictly for laboratory and research use only - they are NOT intended for human consumption. All products are clearly labeled for their intended purpose. Researchers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations."

    faqs: [
      {
        question: "What is the purity of your peptides?",
        answer: "We guarantee a minimum purity of 98% for all research peptides, with many products exceeding 99% purity. Every batch is tested using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and verified through Mass Spectrometry analysis."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide Certificates of Analysis (COA)?",

      },
      {
        question: "How do you test your peptides?",
        answer: "All peptides undergo rigorous quality control including: HPLC analysis for purity verification, Mass Spectrometry (MS) for molecular weight confirmation, appearance inspection, and solubility testing. Only batches meeting our strict standards are released for sale."
      },
      {
        question: "What does HPLC purity mean?",
        answer: "HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) purity indicates the percentage of the target peptide in the sample. A 98% HPLC purity means that 98% of the sample consists of the intended peptide, with minimal impurities or degradation products."
      },
      {
        question: "Are your peptides pharmaceutical grade?",
        answer: "Our peptides are research-grade with pharmaceutical-level purity (≥98%). They are synthesized using the same methods as pharmaceutical peptides but are intended for research purposes only, not therapeutic use."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you ensure batch-to-batch consistency?",
        answer: "We work with ISO-certified manufacturers who follow strict GMP-like protocols. Each batch is independently tested, and we maintain detailed records to ensure consistent quality across all production runs."

    icon: "thermometer",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How should I store my peptides?",
        answer: "Lyophilized (freeze-dried) peptides should be stored at -20°C for long-term storage. Short-term storage at 4°C (refrigerator) is acceptable. Keep peptides away from light and moisture. Reconstituted peptides should be stored at 4°C and used within the timeframe specified on the COA."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do peptides remain stable?",
        answer: "Lyophilized peptides stored at -20°C typically remain stable for 2+ years. At 4°C, stability is generally 6-12 months. Reconstituted peptides have shorter stability, typically 2-4 weeks when refrigerated. Always check the expiration date on your COA."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide reconstitution instructions?",
        answer: "Yes, general reconstitution guidelines are provided with each order. Typically, peptides are reconstituted with bacteriostatic water or sterile water. Specific protocols depend on your research requirements."
      },
      {
        question: "What is bacteriostatic water and why is it used?",
        answer: "Bacteriostatic water is sterile water containing 0.9% benzyl alcohol, which inhibits bacterial growth. It's preferred for reconstituting peptides that will be used over multiple days, as it helps maintain sterility and extends the solution's usability."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I freeze reconstituted peptides?",
        answer: "Generally, we don't recommend freezing reconstituted peptides as freeze-thaw cycles can cause degradation. If you must freeze, aliquot into single-use portions to avoid repeated freezing and thawing."
      },
      {
        question: "My peptide arrived at room temperature - is it still good?",
        answer: "Lyophilized peptides are stable at room temperature for short periods during transit (typically several days). As long as the seal is intact and the peptide appears as expected (usually a white powder), it should be fine. Store properly upon receipt."

      },
      {
        question: "What if I receive a damaged or incorrect product?",

      },
      {
        question: "How long do refunds take to process?",
        answer: "Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days after we receive and inspect the returned item. Bank transfer refunds may take an additional 2-3 days to appear in your account. Bitcoin refunds are processed at the current exchange rate."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I exchange a product for a different one?",

      },
      {
        question: "What if my peptide doesn't meet purity specifications?",

      },
      {
        question: "Do you refund shipping costs?",
        answer: "Shipping costs are refunded if the return is due to our error (wrong item, damaged product, etc.). For change-of-mind returns, original shipping costs are non-refundable and return shipping is the customer's responsibility."
