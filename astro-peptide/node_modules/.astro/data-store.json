These compounds have become essential tools in metabolic research, particularly in studies related to glucose homeostasis, appetite regulation, and energy metabolism.\n\n## The Science Behind GLP-1\n\nGLP-1 is released from intestinal L-cells in response to nutrient intake. It acts on multiple target tissues:\n\n### Pancreatic Effects\n- **Beta cells**: Enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion\n- **Alpha cells**: Suppresses glucagon release when glucose is elevated\n- **Delta cells**: May influence somatostatin secretion\n\n### Extra-Pancreatic Effects\n- **Central nervous system**: Reduces appetite and food intake\n- **Gastrointestinal tract**: Slows gastric emptying\n- **Cardiovascular system**: Potential cardioprotective effects\n\n## Key GLP-1 Peptides for Research\n\n### Semaglutide\nSemaglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist with a half-life of approximately one week. Its extended duration of action makes it particularly valuable for research into sustained metabolic effects.\n\n**Research Applications:**\n- Metabolic pathway studies\n- Appetite regulation mechanisms\n- Glucose homeostasis research\n- Cardiovascular effects in metabolic contexts\n\n### Tirzepatide\nTirzepatide represents a new class of dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists. This dual mechanism provides researchers with a unique tool for studying the interplay between these two incretin systems.\n\n**Research Applications:**\n- Dual incretin signaling studies\n- Comparative metabolic research\n- Body composition analysis\n- Insulin sensitivity research\n\n### Retatrutide\nThe newest addition to the GLP-1 research arsenal, Retatrutide is a triple agonist targeting GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors. This multi-receptor approach opens new avenues for metabolic research.\n\n## Quality Considerations When Buying Semaglutide UK\n\nWhen purchasing research peptides, quality is paramount. At Peptide Shop, we ensure:\n\n- **≥99% HPLC Purity**: Every batch tested and verified\n- **Certificate of Analysis**: Full documentation included\n- **Proper Storage**: Shipped in temperature-controlled packaging\n- **Fast UK Delivery**: Same-day dispatch before 2pm\n\n## Research Protocol Considerations\n\nWhen designing research protocols with GLP-1 agonists, consider:\n\n1. **Reconstitution**: Use bacteriostatic water for multi-use applications\n2. **Storage**: Keep reconstituted peptides at 2-8°C\n3. **Stability**: Most GLP-1 analogs remain stable for 4-6 weeks when reconstituted\n4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed logs for reproducibility\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGLP-1 receptor agonists represent one of the most significant advances in metabolic research.

Unverzichtbar für unsere Inkretin-Mechanismus-Studien.","## Was ist Tirzepatide?\n\n**Tirzepatide** ist ein neuartiges synthetisches Peptid, das als dualer Agonist von zwei wichtigen Inkretin-Hormonrezeptoren fungiert: glukoseabhängiges insulinotropes Polypeptid (GIP) und glucagon-ähnliches Peptid-1 (GLP-1). Dieser einzigartige duale Wirkmechanismus unterscheidet Tirzepatide von Single-Target GLP-1-Rezeptoragonisten wie Semaglutide und macht es zu einem unverzichtbaren Werkzeug für die Stoffwechselforschung.\n\nDie Peptidstruktur enthält eine modifizierte GIP-Sequenz mit sorgfältig entwickelten Aminosäuresubstitutionen und einer C20-Fettsäure-Diacid-Seitenkette, die an Lysin angebracht ist. Diese Modifikation ermöglicht die Bindung an Serumalbumin, wodurch die biologische Halbwertszeit auf etwa fünf Tage verlängert wird und Forscher anhaltende duale Rezeptoraktivierung untersuchen können.\n\nPeptide Shop liefert **Forschungsqualität Tirzepatide** mit garantierter ≥99% Reinheit, verifiziert durch umfassende HPLC- und Massenspektrometrie-Analyse. Jede Bestellung enthält ein detailliertes Analysezertifikat, um sicherzustellen, dass Forscher ordnungsgemäß charakterisiertes Material für ihre Studien erhalten.\n\n## Wie funktioniert Tirzepatide?\n\nTirzepatide übt seine biologischen Wirkungen durch gleichzeitige Aktivierung von GIP- und GLP-1-Rezeptoren aus, die beide G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren sind, die in verschiedenen metabolisch aktiven Geweben exprimiert werden. Dieser duale Agonismus erzeugt synergistische Signaleffekte, die Forscher weiter charakterisieren.\n\n### Duale Inkretin-Rezeptor-Aktivierung\n\nDer GIP-Rezeptor wird hauptsächlich in pankreatischen Betazellen und Fettgewebe exprimiert, während GLP-1-Rezeptoren in Pankreasinseln, Gehirn, Herz und Magen-Darm-Trakt zu finden sind. Durch die gleichzeitige Aktivierung beider Rezeptorsysteme bietet Tirzepatide Forschern ein einzigartiges Werkzeug zur Untersuchung von:\n\n- **Synergistische Insulinsekretion** - Kombinierte GIP- und GLP-1-Signalübertragung verstärkt die glukoseabhängige Insulinfreisetzung über das hinaus, was jedes Hormon allein erreicht\n- **Verbesserte metabolische Effekte** - Duale Aktivierung kann die Insulinsensitivität durch Mechanismen verbessern, die sich von Einzelagonisten-Peptiden unterscheiden\n- **Verbesserte Gewichtsergebnisse** - Forschung legt nahe, dass der duale Mechanismus überlegene Gewichtsverlusteffekte im Vergleich zu GLP-1-Monoagonisten bieten kann\n\n## Forschungsanwendungen von Tirzepatide\n\n### Vergleichende Inkretin-Forschung\n\nTirzepatide ermöglicht entscheidende Vergleichsstudien zwischen:\n\n- Einzelne GLP-1-Rezeptoragonisten vs. dualer GIP/GLP-1 Agonismus\n- GIP-Rezeptor-spezifische Effekte in der metabolischen Regulation\n- Rezeptorselektivitätsprofile und ihre physiologischen Konsequenzen\n\n### Metabolisches Syndrom Studien\n\nDer duale Agonist ist wertvoll für die Untersuchung von:\n\n- **Multi-Organ metabolische Koordination** - Verstehen, wie duale Inkretin-Signalübertragung den Gesamtkörperstoffwechsel beeinflusst\n- **Insulinresistenz-Mechanismen** - Untersuchung potenzieller Verbesserungen der peripheren Insulinsensitivität\n- **Hepatische Glukoseproduktion** - Untersuchung der Auswirkungen auf den Leberstoffwechsel\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide: Wichtige Forschungsunterschiede\n\n| Merkmal | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Rezeptor-Ziele** | GIP + GLP-1 (dual) | Nur GLP-1 |\n| **Halbwertszeit** | ~5 Tage | ~7 Tage |\n| **Molekulargewicht** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Fettsäure-Modifikation** | C20 Diacid | C18 Diacid |\n| **Forschungsfokus** | Duale Inkretin-Synergie | GLP-1 spezifische Mechanismen |\n\n## Tirzepatide Peptid Spezifikationen\n\n| Spezifikation | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS-Nummer** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Molekularformel** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Molekulargewicht** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Reinheit** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Aussehen** | Weißes bis cremefarbenes lyophilisiertes Pulver |\n| **Löslichkeit** | Löslich in Wasser; kann sanftes Erwärmen erfordern |\n| **Identität** | Bestätigt durch Massenspektrometrie |\n\n## Warum Peptide Shop für Tirzepatide wählen?\n\n### Verifizierte Reinheit\n\nUnser Tirzepatide durchläuft strenge Qualitätsprüfungen mit ≥99% Reinheit, verifiziert durch HPLC.

This makes it ideal for reconstituting lyophilized (freeze-dried) peptides for research applications where multiple withdrawals from the same vial are needed.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### USP Grade Quality\nOur bacteriostatic water meets United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for:\n- Sterility\n- Purity  \n- Benzyl alcohol concentration (0.9%)\n- Endotoxin levels\n\n### Multi-Use Design\nUnlike single-use sterile water, bacteriostatic water allows multiple withdrawals over several weeks without contamination risk, making it cost-effective for research laboratories.\n\n### Convenient 10ml Size\nEach 10ml vial can reconstitute 5-10 peptide vials depending on concentration requirements.\n\n## How to Use Bacteriostatic Water\n\n### Reconstitution Steps\n1. Allow the peptide vial to reach room temperature\n2. Clean both vial tops with an alcohol swab\n3. Using a sterile syringe, withdraw the desired amount of bacteriostatic water\n4. Insert the needle into the peptide vial, aiming at the glass wall\n5. Slowly inject the water, allowing it to run down the vial wall\n6. Gently swirl (do not shake) until fully dissolved\n7.

Through fatty acid acylation, cagrilintide achieves an extended half-life enabling once-weekly research dosing, making it an invaluable tool for studying amylin's role in satiety and metabolic regulation.\n\nAmylin complements insulin's glucose-lowering effects through distinct mechanisms including gastric emptying delay, glucagon suppression, and central satiety signalling. Cagrilintide provides researchers with a stable, long-acting tool to investigate these pathways in extended experimental paradigms.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Cagrilintide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis.\n\n## How Does Cagrilintide Work?\n\nCagrilintide activates amylin receptors (AMY1, AMY2, AMY3), which are complexes of the calcitonin receptor with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs).\n\n### Satiety Signalling\n\nCentral effects include:\n- **Area postrema activation** - Key brainstem satiety centre\n- **Meal size reduction** - Promoting earlier termination of eating\n- **Palatability effects** - Modifying food preference in models\n- **Hypothalamic signalling** - Complementing leptin pathways\n\n### Gastric Effects\n\nPeripheral actions include:\n- **Gastric emptying delay** - Prolonging nutrient absorption\n- **Glucagon suppression** - Reducing hepatic glucose output\n- **Postprandial glucose control** - Smoothing glycemic excursions\n\n### Combination Research\n\nCagrilintide is often studied with GLP-1 agonists:\n- **Complementary mechanisms** - Different satiety pathways\n- **Enhanced efficacy** - Potentially additive effects\n- **CagriSema research** - Combined with semaglutide\n\n## Cagrilintide Peptide Specifications\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 2375614-45-8 |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 3962.4 g/mol |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in water |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Storage and Handling\n\n| Condition | Temperature | Duration |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | Up to 3 weeks |\n\n## Ordering Information\n\n| Size | Price |\n|------|-------|\n| **2 mg** | From £58 |\n| **5 mg** | From £140 |\n\n**Minimum order: £200** | **10% discount on orders over £200**\n\n## Research Use Statement\n\n**For laboratory research only.** Not intended for human or veterinary use.","src/content/products/en/cagrilintide.md","8bf00d6f8cd91d9c",{"html":6068,"metadata":6069},"\u003Ch2 id=\"what-is-cagrilintide\">What is Cagrilintide?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Cagrilintide\u003C/strong> (AM833, NN9838) is a long-acting acylated analog of human amylin, a peptide hormone co-secreted with insulin from pancreatic beta cells.

Peptide Shop delivers on quality, documentation, and customer service. Our new preferred supplier.","## What is Semaglutide?\n\n**Semaglutide** is a synthetic analogue of human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone naturally produced in the intestines that plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and appetite regulation. This research peptide has gained significant attention in scientific communities worldwide for its applications in metabolic research, particularly in studies related to type 2 diabetes and obesity. For comprehensive background information, see the [PubChem compound entry for Semaglutide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Semaglutide){:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"}.\n\nThe molecular structure of Semaglutide features a unique C-18 fatty diacid chain attached to the lysine residue at position 26. This structural modification enables the peptide to bind to serum albumin, dramatically extending its biological half-life to approximately seven days. This prolonged activity profile makes Semaglutide an invaluable tool for researchers studying sustained GLP-1 receptor activation mechanisms.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Semaglutide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified by HPLC analysis and mass spectrometry. Every order includes a comprehensive Certificate of Analysis (COA), ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Semaglutide Work?\n\nSemaglutide exerts its biological effects through high-affinity binding to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in various tissues including pancreatic beta cells, the central nervous system, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. Upon receptor binding, Semaglutide initiates several downstream signalling cascades that researchers continue to investigate.\n\n### Pancreatic Effects\n\nIn pancreatic beta cells, GLP-1 receptor activation by Semaglutide triggers glucose-dependent insulin secretion through the cAMP-PKA signalling pathway. This glucose-dependent mechanism is particularly noteworthy in research, as it suggests reduced risk of hypoglycaemia compared to insulin secretagogues that work independently of glucose levels.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that Semaglutide may also promote beta-cell proliferation and reduce apoptosis in preclinical models, suggesting potential applications in studying beta-cell preservation strategies.\n\n### Central Nervous System Actions\n\nSemaglutide crosses the blood-brain barrier and activates GLP-1 receptors in key hypothalamic regions involved in appetite regulation, including the arcuate nucleus and paraventricular nucleus. Research indicates that this central action contributes to reduced food intake and altered food preferences in animal models.\n\nEmerging research also explores Semaglutide's potential neuroprotective properties, with studies investigating its effects in models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke.\n\n### Gastrointestinal Effects\n\nGLP-1 receptor activation slows gastric emptying, which may contribute to prolonged satiety and reduced postprandial glucose excursions. Researchers studying gut-brain axis signalling find Semaglutide particularly useful for investigating these gastrointestinal regulatory mechanisms.\n\n## Research Applications of Semaglutide\n\n### Metabolic Research\n\nSemaglutide is extensively used in metabolic research laboratories studying:\n\n- **Glucose homeostasis mechanisms** - Understanding how GLP-1 receptor activation influences blood glucose regulation\n- **Insulin secretion dynamics** - Investigating the molecular pathways governing glucose-dependent insulin release\n- **Beta-cell biology** - Studying potential regenerative and protective effects on pancreatic beta cells\n- **Glucagon suppression** - Researching the relationship between GLP-1 signalling and alpha-cell function\n\n### Weight Management Studies\n\nThe peptide's effects on body weight have made it crucial for obesity research, including studies on:\n\n- **Appetite regulation** - Investigating central mechanisms controlling food intake and satiety\n- **Energy expenditure** - Studying metabolic rate changes associated with GLP-1 receptor activation\n- **Food preference alteration** - Researching how GLP-1 signalling affects dietary choices in animal models\n- **Adipose tissue biology** - Understanding effects on fat storage and metabolism\n\n### Cardiovascular Research\n\nEmerging evidence suggests GLP-1 receptor agonists may have cardiovascular effects beyond glucose control, leading to research investigating:\n\n- **Endothelial function** - Studying vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties\n- **Cardiac metabolism** - Investigating effects on myocardial glucose and fatty acid utilisation\n- **Atherosclerosis progression** - Researching potential anti-atherogenic mechanisms\n\n### Neuroscience Applications\n\nThe presence of GLP-1 receptors in the brain has sparked significant neuroscience research using Semaglutide:\n\n- **Neurodegeneration models** - Investigating potential protective effects in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models\n- **Stroke recovery** - Studying effects on neuronal survival and functional recovery\n- **Cognitive function** - Researching impacts on learning and memory in animal models\n\n## Semaglutide Peptide Specifications\n\nOur research-grade Semaglutide meets the highest quality standards required for reproducible scientific research:\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 910463-68-2 |\n| **Molecular Formula** | C₁₈₇H₂₉₁N₄₅O₅₉ |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Sequence** | Modified GLP-1 (7-37) with Aib at position 8 and C-18 fatty diacid at Lys-26 |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in water at pH >7.0; slightly alkaline buffer recommended |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Protocol\n\nFor optimal results in research applications, follow these reconstitution guidelines:\n\n1. **Allow the vial to reach room temperature** before opening to prevent moisture condensation on the lyophilised peptide\n2. **Calculate the required concentration** for your research application\n3. **Use sterile bacteriostatic water** or a slightly alkaline buffer (pH 7.4-8.0) as the reconstitution vehicle\n4. **Add the solvent slowly** along the vial wall, not directly onto the peptide\n5. **Gently swirl the vial** to dissolve - never shake vigorously as this may cause peptide degradation\n6. **Ensure complete dissolution** before aliquoting for experiments\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n| Condition | Storage Temperature | Recommended Duration |\n|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | Up to 4 weeks |\n| **Working aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 3 months |\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n- Protect from light during storage\n- Store in airtight containers to prevent moisture absorption\n- Use sterile technique during handling\n\n## Why Choose Peptide Shop for Semaglutide?\n\n### Guaranteed Purity\n\nEvery batch of our Semaglutide undergoes rigorous quality control testing.

Product quality was exactly as described.","## What is Tirzepatide?\n\n**Tirzepatide** is a novel synthetic peptide that functions as a dual agonist of two key incretin hormone receptors: glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). This unique dual mechanism of action distinguishes Tirzepatide from single-target GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide, making it an invaluable tool for metabolic research.\n\nThe peptide's structure incorporates a modified GIP sequence with carefully engineered amino acid substitutions and a C20 fatty diacid side chain attached to lysine. This modification enables binding to serum albumin, extending the biological half-life to approximately five days and allowing researchers to study sustained dual receptor activation.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Tirzepatide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis to ensure researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Tirzepatide Work?\n\nTirzepatide exerts its biological effects through simultaneous activation of GIP and GLP-1 receptors, both of which are G protein-coupled receptors expressed in various metabolically active tissues. This dual agonism creates synergistic signalling effects that researchers continue to characterise.\n\n### Dual Incretin Receptor Activation\n\nThe GIP receptor is predominantly expressed in pancreatic beta cells and adipose tissue, while GLP-1 receptors are found in pancreatic islets, brain, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. By activating both receptor systems simultaneously, Tirzepatide provides researchers with a unique tool for studying:\n\n- **Synergistic insulin secretion** - Combined GIP and GLP-1 signalling enhances glucose-dependent insulin release beyond what either hormone achieves alone\n- **Enhanced metabolic effects** - Dual activation may improve insulin sensitivity through mechanisms distinct from single-agonist peptides\n- **Improved weight outcomes** - Research suggests the dual mechanism may provide superior weight loss effects compared to GLP-1 mono-agonists\n\n### Pancreatic Beta-Cell Effects\n\nIn pancreatic beta cells, Tirzepatide activates both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, leading to:\n\n- **Enhanced cAMP production** through dual receptor stimulation\n- **Improved glucose sensing** and insulin granule exocytosis\n- **Potential beta-cell protective effects** under metabolic stress conditions\n- **Reduced glucagon secretion** from pancreatic alpha cells\n\n### Central Nervous System Actions\n\nLike GLP-1 agonists, Tirzepatide affects appetite regulation through central mechanisms. Research indicates effects on:\n\n- **Hypothalamic appetite centres** - Modulating food intake signalling\n- **Reward pathway activity** - Potentially influencing food preferences\n- **Gastric emptying rates** - Contributing to prolonged satiety\n\n### Adipose Tissue Effects\n\nThe GIP receptor component may provide unique effects on adipose tissue:\n\n- **Enhanced lipid metabolism** - GIP signalling influences adipocyte function\n- **Improved insulin sensitivity** - Fat tissue-specific effects may contribute to metabolic improvements\n- **Altered adipokine secretion** - Potential effects on adiponectin and leptin\n\n## Research Applications of Tirzepatide\n\n### Comparative Incretin Research\n\nTirzepatide enables crucial comparative studies between:\n\n- Single GLP-1 receptor agonists vs dual GIP/GLP-1 agonism\n- GIP receptor-specific effects in metabolic regulation\n- Receptor selectivity profiles and their physiological consequences\n\n### Metabolic Syndrome Studies\n\nThe dual agonist is valuable for investigating:\n\n- **Multi-organ metabolic coordination** - Understanding how dual incretin signalling affects whole-body metabolism\n- **Insulin resistance mechanisms** - Studying potential improvements in peripheral insulin sensitivity\n- **Hepatic glucose production** - Investigating effects on liver metabolism\n\n### Weight Management Research\n\nTirzepatide's superior weight outcomes in preclinical models make it essential for:\n\n- **Appetite regulation studies** - Comparing dual vs single agonist effects on food intake\n- **Energy expenditure research** - Investigating metabolic rate changes\n- **Adipose tissue biology** - Understanding fat mass reduction mechanisms\n\n### Cardiovascular Research\n\nEmerging areas of investigation include:\n\n- **Cardiac metabolism** - Effects on myocardial glucose and lipid utilisation\n- **Vascular function** - Potential endothelial effects of dual agonism\n- **Blood pressure regulation** - Understanding cardiovascular impacts\n\n### Diabetes Research\n\nCore applications in diabetes studies include:\n\n- **Beta-cell preservation** - Investigating protective effects on insulin-producing cells\n- **Glucose homeostasis** - Studying blood glucose regulation mechanisms\n- **Incretin physiology** - Understanding the incretin effect in normal and diabetic states\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide: Key Research Differences\n\n| Feature | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Receptor Targets** | GIP + GLP-1 (dual) | GLP-1 only |\n| **Half-life** | ~5 days | ~7 days |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Fatty Acid Modification** | C20 diacid | C18 diacid |\n| **Research Focus** | Dual incretin synergy | GLP-1 specific mechanisms |\n\nBoth peptides are available from Peptide Shop in research-grade purity, allowing direct comparison studies.\n\n## Tirzepatide Peptide Specifications\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Molecular Formula** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in water; may require gentle warming |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Protocol\n\n1. **Equilibrate to room temperature** before opening the vial\n2. **Calculate required concentration** based on your experimental design\n3. **Add sterile bacteriostatic water** slowly along the vial wall\n4. **Gently swirl** to dissolve - avoid shaking\n5. **Allow complete dissolution** before use\n6. **Aliquot immediately** to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n| Condition | Temperature | Duration |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | Up to 4 weeks |\n| **Working aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 3 months |\n\n## Why Choose Peptide Shop for Tirzepatide?\n\n### Verified Purity\n\nOur Tirzepatide undergoes rigorous quality testing with ≥99% purity verified by HPLC.

Esto la hace ideal para reconstituir péptidos liofilizados (secados por congelación) para aplicaciones de investigación donde se necesitan múltiples extracciones del mismo vial.\n\n## Características Principales\n\n### Calidad USP\nNuestra agua bacteriostática cumple con los estándares United States Pharmacopeia (USP) para:\n- Esterilidad\n- Pureza  \n- Concentración de alcohol bencílico (0,9%)\n- Niveles de endotoxinas\n\n### Diseño Multi-Uso\nA diferencia del agua estéril de un solo uso, el agua bacteriostática permite múltiples extracciones durante varias semanas sin riesgo de contaminación, haciéndola rentable para laboratorios de investigación.\n\n### Tamaño Conveniente de 10ml\nCada vial de 10ml puede reconstituir 5-10 viales de péptidos dependiendo de los requisitos de concentración.\n\n## Cómo Usar el Agua Bacteriostática\n\n### Pasos de Reconstitución\n1. Permitir que el vial de péptido alcance temperatura ambiente\n2. Limpiar ambas tapas de vial con una toallita de alcohol\n3. Usando una jeringa estéril, extraer la cantidad deseada de agua bacteriostática\n4. Insertar la aguja en el vial de péptido, apuntando a la pared de vidrio\n5. Inyectar lentamente el agua, permitiendo que corra por la pared del vial\n6. Agitar suavemente (no sacudir) hasta que esté completamente disuelto\n7. Almacenar el péptido reconstituido a 2-8°C\n\n### Volúmenes Recomendados\n| Cantidad de Péptido | Agua BAC Sugerida | Concentración |\n|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| 5mg | 1,0ml | 5mg/ml |\n| 5mg | 2,0ml | 2,5mg/ml |\n| 10mg | 2,0ml | 5mg/ml |\n| 10mg | 4,0ml | 2,5mg/ml |\n\n## Instrucciones de Almacenamiento\n\n- **Sin abrir**: Almacenar a temperatura ambiente (15-25°C), alejado de luz directa\n- **Abierto**: Usar dentro de 28 días\n- **No congelar**: Congelar puede comprometer la esterilidad\n- **Vida útil**: 2 años desde la fecha de fabricación\n\n## Aplicaciones en Investigación\n\nEl agua bacteriostática es esencial para:\n- Reconstitución de péptidos para estudios in vitro\n- Preparación de soluciones madre\n- Protocolos de investigación multi-día que requieren muestreo repetido\n- Cualquier aplicación donde la esterilidad debe mantenerse en el tiempo\n\n## Garantía de Calidad\n\nCada lote de nuestra agua bacteriostática se somete a pruebas de:\n- **Esterilidad**: Probado según USP \u003C71>\n- **Endotoxinas**: Probado según USP \u003C85>\n- **Material Particulado**: Probado según USP \u003C788>\n- **Contenido de Alcohol Bencílico**: Verificado en 0,9% ± 0,05%\n\n***\n\n*El agua bacteriostática está destinada únicamente para uso de investigación.

Esencial para nuestros estudios de mecanismos de incretinas.","## ¿Qué es el Tirzepatide?\n\n**El Tirzepatide** es un nuevo péptido sintético que funciona como un agonista dual de dos receptores de hormonas incretinas clave: el polipéptido insulinotrópico dependiente de glucosa (GIP) y el péptido-1 similar al glucagón (GLP-1). Este mecanismo de acción dual único distingue al Tirzepatide de los agonistas de receptores GLP-1 de objetivo único como el semaglutide, convirtiéndolo en una herramienta invaluable para la investigación metabólica.\n\nLa estructura del péptido incorpora una secuencia GIP modificada con sustituciones de aminoácidos cuidadosamente diseñadas y una cadena lateral de diácido graso C20 unida a la lisina. Esta modificación permite la unión a la albúmina sérica, extendiendo la vida media biológica a aproximadamente cinco días y permitiendo a los investigadores estudiar la activación sostenida de receptores duales.\n\nPeptide Shop suministra **Tirzepatide de grado de investigación** con pureza garantizada ≥99%, verificada mediante análisis HPLC y espectrometría de masas completa.

Cela la rend idéale pour reconstituer les peptides lyophilisés (séchés par congélation) pour les applications de recherche où plusieurs prélèvements du même flacon sont nécessaires.\n\n## Caractéristiques Principales\n\n### Qualité USP\nNotre eau bactériostatique répond aux normes United States Pharmacopeia (USP) pour:\n- Stérilité\n- Pureté  \n- Concentration d'alcool benzylique (0,9%)\n- Niveaux d'endotoxines\n\n### Conception Multi-Usage\nContrairement à l'eau stérile à usage unique, l'eau bactériostatique permet plusieurs prélèvements sur plusieurs semaines sans risque de contamination, ce qui la rend économique pour les laboratoires de recherche.\n\n### Taille Pratique de 10ml\nChaque flacon de 10ml peut reconstituer 5-10 flacons de peptides selon les exigences de concentration.\n\n## Comment Utiliser l'Eau Bactériostatique\n\n### Étapes de Reconstitution\n1. Laisser le flacon de peptide atteindre la température ambiante\n2. Nettoyer les deux bouchons de flacon avec un tampon alcoolisé\n3. À l'aide d'une seringue stérile, prélever la quantité souhaitée d'eau bactériostatique\n4. Insérer l'aiguille dans le flacon de peptide, en visant la paroi de verre\n5. Injecter lentement l'eau, en la laissant couler le long de la paroi du flacon\n6. Agiter doucement (ne pas secouer) jusqu'à dissolution complète\n7.

Questo la rende ideale per ricostituire peptidi liofilizzati (essiccati a freddo) per applicazioni di ricerca dove sono necessari prelievi multipli dalla stessa fiala.\n\n## Caratteristiche Principali\n\n### Qualità USP\nLa nostra acqua batteriostatica soddisfa gli standard United States Pharmacopeia (USP) per:\n- Sterilità\n- Purezza  \n- Concentrazione di alcol benzilico (0,9%)\n- Livelli di endotossine\n\n### Design Multi-Uso\nA differenza dell'acqua sterile monouso, l'acqua batteriostatica consente prelievi multipli per diverse settimane senza rischio di contaminazione, rendendola economica per i laboratori di ricerca.\n\n### Pratica Dimensione da 10ml\nOgni fiala da 10ml può ricostituire 5-10 fiale di peptidi a seconda dei requisiti di concentrazione.\n\n## Come Usare l'Acqua Batteriostatica\n\n### Passaggi di Ricostituzione\n1. Lasciare che la fiala di peptide raggiunga la temperatura ambiente\n2. Pulire entrambi i tappi delle fiale con un tampone alcolico\n3. Usando una siringa sterile, prelevare la quantità desiderata di acqua batteriostatica\n4. Inserire l'ago nella fiala di peptide, puntando verso la parete di vetro\n5. Iniettare lentamente l'acqua, lasciandola scorrere lungo la parete della fiala\n6. Agitare delicatamente (non scuotere) fino a completa dissoluzione\n7.

Essenziale per i nostri studi sui meccanismi incretinici.","## Cos'è il Tirzepatide?\n\n**Il Tirzepatide** è un nuovo peptide sintetico che funziona come agonista doppio di due recettori chiave degli ormoni incretinici: il polipeptide insulinotropico glucosio-dipendente (GIP) e il peptide-1 simile al glucagone (GLP-1). Questo meccanismo d'azione doppio unico distingue il Tirzepatide dagli agonisti dei recettori GLP-1 a singolo bersaglio come il semaglutide, rendendolo uno strumento inestimabile per la ricerca metabolica.\n\nLa struttura del peptide incorpora una sequenza GIP modificata con sostituzioni di amminoacidi accuratamente progettate e una catena laterale di diacido grasso C20 attaccata alla lisina. Questa modifica consente il legame con l'albumina sierica, estendendo l'emivita biologica a circa cinque giorni e permettendo ai ricercatori di studiare l'attivazione sostenuta dei doppi recettori.\n\nPeptide Shop fornisce **Tirzepatide di grado di ricerca** con purezza garantita ≥99%, verificata tramite analisi HPLC e spettrometria di massa completa.

Dit maakt het ideaal voor het reconstitueren van gelyofiliseerde (gevriesdroogde) peptiden voor onderzoekstoepassingen waarbij meerdere onttrekkingen uit dezelfde flacon nodig zijn.\n\n## Belangrijkste Kenmerken\n\n### USP Kwaliteit\nOns bacteriostatisch water voldoet aan United States Pharmacopeia (USP) normen voor:\n- Steriliteit\n- Zuiverheid  \n- Benzylalcohol concentratie (0,9%)\n- Endotoxine niveaus\n\n### Multi-Use Ontwerp\nIn tegenstelling tot steriel water voor eenmalig gebruik, maakt bacteriostatisch water meerdere onttrekkingen over meerdere weken mogelijk zonder besmettingsrisico, wat het kosteneffectief maakt voor onderzoekslaboratoria.\n\n### Handige 10ml Maat\nElke 10ml flacon kan 5-10 peptide flacons reconstitueren, afhankelijk van concentratie-eisen.\n\n## Hoe Bacteriostatisch Water te Gebruiken\n\n### Reconstitutie Stappen\n1.

Essentieel voor onze incretine-mechanismestudies.","## Wat is Tirzepatide?\n\n**Tirzepatide** is een nieuw synthetisch peptide dat functioneert als een duale agonist van twee belangrijke incretine-hormoonreceptoren: glucose-afhankelijk insulinotroop polypeptide (GIP) en glucagon-achtig peptide-1 (GLP-1). Dit unieke dubbele werkingsmechanisme onderscheidt Tirzepatide van single-target GLP-1-receptor agonisten zoals semaglutide, waardoor het een onmisbaar instrument is voor metabool onderzoek.\n\nDe structuur van het peptide bevat een gemodificeerde GIP-sequentie met zorgvuldig ontworpen aminozuursubstituties en een C20 vetzuur-diacid zijketen bevestigd aan lysine. Deze modificatie maakt binding aan serumalbumine mogelijk, waardoor de biologische halfwaardetijd wordt verlengd tot ongeveer vijf dagen en onderzoekers aanhoudende duale receptoractivatie kunnen bestuderen.\n\nPeptide Shop levert **onderzoekskwaliteit Tirzepatide** met gegarandeerde ≥99% zuiverheid, geverifieerd door uitgebreide HPLC- en massaspectrometrie-analyse. Elke bestelling bevat een gedetailleerd Analysecertificaat om ervoor te zorgen dat onderzoekers correct gekarakteriseerd materiaal ontvangen voor hun studies.\n\n## Hoe Werkt Tirzepatide?\n\nTirzepatide oefent zijn biologische effecten uit door gelijktijdige activatie van GIP- en GLP-1-receptoren, die beide G-eiwit-gekoppelde receptoren zijn die tot expressie komen in verschillende metabool actieve weefsels. Dit duale agonisme creëert synergetische signaaleffecten die onderzoekers blijven karakteriseren.\n\n### Duale Incretine Receptor Activatie\n\nDe GIP-receptor komt voornamelijk tot expressie in pancreatische bètacellen en vetweefsel, terwijl GLP-1-receptoren worden gevonden in pancreatische eilandjes, hersenen, hart en maag-darmkanaal. Door beide receptorsystemen gelijktijdig te activeren, biedt Tirzepatide onderzoekers een uniek instrument voor het bestuderen van:\n\n- **Synergetische insulinesecretie** - Gecombineerde GIP- en GLP-1-signalering verbetert glucose-afhankelijke insuline-afgifte meer dan elk hormoon alleen bereikt\n- **Verbeterde metabole effecten** - Duale activatie kan de insulinegevoeligheid verbeteren via mechanismen die verschillen van single-agonist peptiden\n- **Verbeterde gewichtsuitkomsten** - Onderzoek suggereert dat het dubbele mechanisme superieure gewichtsverlieseffecten kan bieden in vergelijking met GLP-1 mono-agonisten\n\n## Onderzoekstoepassingen van Tirzepatide\n\n### Vergelijkend Incretine Onderzoek\n\nTirzepatide maakt cruciale vergelijkende studies mogelijk tussen:\n\n- Single GLP-1-receptor agonisten versus duale GIP/GLP-1 agonisme\n- GIP-receptor-specifieke effecten in metabole regulatie\n- Receptorselectiviteitsprofielen en hun fysiologische consequenties\n\n### Metabool Syndroom Studies\n\nDe duale agonist is waardevol voor het onderzoeken van:\n\n- **Multi-orgaan metabole coördinatie** - Begrijpen hoe duale incretine-signalering het metabolisme van het hele lichaam beïnvloedt\n- **Insulineresistentiemechanismen** - Bestuderen van potentiële verbeteringen in perifere insulinegevoeligheid\n- **Hepatische glucoseproductie** - Onderzoeken van effecten op levermetabolisme\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide: Belangrijkste Onderzoeksverschillen\n\n| Kenmerk | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Receptor Targets** | GIP + GLP-1 (duaal) | Alleen GLP-1 |\n| **Halfwaardetijd** | ~5 dagen | ~7 dagen |\n| **Molecuulgewicht** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Vetzuurmodificatie** | C20 diacid | C18 diacid |\n| **Onderzoeksfocus** | Duale incretine synergie | GLP-1 specifieke mechanismen |\n\n## Tirzepatide Peptide Specificaties\n\n| Specificatie | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Nummer** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Moleculaire Formule** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Molecuulgewicht** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Zuiverheid** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Uiterlijk** | Wit tot gebroken wit gelyofiliseerd poeder |\n| **Oplosbaarheid** | Oplosbaar in water; kan voorzichtige verwarming vereisen |\n| **Identiteit** | Bevestigd door massaspectrometrie |\n\n## Waarom Kiezen voor Peptide Shop voor Tirzepatide?\n\n### Geverifieerde Zuiverheid\n\nOnze Tirzepatide ondergaat strenge kwaliteitstesten met ≥99% zuiverheid geverifieerd door HPLC.

This makes it ideal for reconstituting лиофилизированный (freeze-dried) Пептидs for research applications where multiple withdrawals from the same vial are needed.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### USP Grade Quality\nOur bacteriostatic Вода meets United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for:\n- Sterility\n- Purity  \n- Benzyl alcohol concentration (0.9%)\n- Endotoxin levels\n\n### Multi-Use Design\nUnlike single-use Стерильный Вода, bacteriostatic Вода allows multiple withdrawals over several weeks without contamination risk, making it cost-effective for research laboratories.\n\n### Convenient 10ml Size\nEach 10ml vial can reconstitute 5-10 Пептид vials depending on concentration requirements.\n\n## How to Use Bacteriostatic Вода\n\n### Reconstitution Steps\n1. Allow the Пептид vial to reach room temperature\n2. Clean both vial tops with an alcohol swab\n3. Using a Стерильный syringe, withdraw the desired amount of bacteriostatic Вода\n4. Insert the needle into the Пептид vial, aiming at the glass wall\n5. Slowly inject the Вода, allowing it to run down the vial wall\n6. Gently swirl (do not shake) until fully dissolved\n7.

Originally developed at the University of Arizona in the 1980s, this Исследовательский пептид has become an essential tool for Исследованиеing melanocortin receptor signalling and the regulation of skin pigmentation.\n\nThe Пептид's cyclic lactam Структура provides enhanced stability and receptor binding affinity compared to linear α-MSH analogues. Melanotan 2 acts as a non-selective agonist at melanocortin receptors MC1, MC3, MC4, and MC5, enabling researchers to Исследование diverse physiological processes beyond pigmentation.\n\nПептид Shop supplies **research-grade Melanotan 2** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis, ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Melanotan 2 Work?\n\nMelanotan 2 exerts its biological effects through activation of melanocortin receptors, a family of G protein-coupled receptors that regulate diverse physiological processes. Understanding these mechanisms is central to ongoing research in dermatology, endocrinology, and neuroscience.\n\n### Melanocortin Receptor Family\n\nMT-2 activates multiple melanocortin receptor subtypes:\n\n- **MC1R** - Primarily expressed in melanocytes; regulates skin pigmentation\n- **MC3R** - Expressed in hypothalamus and peripheral tissues; involved in energy homeostasis\n- **MC4R** - Central nervous system expression; regulates appetite and sexual function\n- **MC5R** - Sebaceous glands and other tissues; less well characterised\n\n### Melanogenesis Pathway\n\nThe primary research application involves Исследованиеing skin pigmentation:\n\n- **MC1R activation** - Triggers intracellular cAMP production in melanocytes\n- **MITF activation** - Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor upregulation\n- **Tyrosinase expression** - Key enzyme in melanin synthesis pathway\n- **Eumelanin production** - Brown-black pigment providing UV protection\n- **Melanosome transfer** - Distribution of pigment to keratinocytes\n\n### Central Nervous System Effects\n\nMT-2's non-selective receptor profile enables diverse CNS research:\n\n- **Appetite regulation** - MC4R activation in hypothalamus suppresses food intake\n- **Energy expenditure** - Effects on metabolic rate through central mechanisms\n- **Sexual behaviour** - Research on erectile function and libido in animal models\n- **Anxiolytic effects** - Studies on stress and anxiety-related behaviours\n\n### Anti-Inflammatory Research\n\nEmerging research explores melanocortin anti-inflammatory properties:\n\n- **Cytokine modulation** - Effects on inflammatory mediator production\n- **Immune cell function** - Research on macrophage and lymphocyte behaviour\n- **Tissue protection** - Studies on inflammation-related damage\n\n## Research Applications of Melanotan 2\n\n### Pigmentation Research\n\nMelanotan 2 is extensively used in dermatological research:\n\n- **Melanogenesis mechanisms** - Understanding pigment production pathways\n- **UV protection** - Research on natural photoprotection\n- **Vitiligo models** - Studies on repigmentation strategies\n- **Melanoma biology** - Understanding MC1R role in melanocyte transformation\n- **Skin ageing** - Research on photoprotection and pigmentary changes\n\n### Appetite and Obesity Research\n\nMC4R activation makes MT-2 valuable for metabolic studies:\n\n- **Food intake regulation** - Investigating central appetite control mechanisms\n- **Satiety signalling** - Research on post-prandial fullness pathways\n- **Energy homeostasis** - Studies on metabolic regulation\n- **Obesity models** - Investigating potential intervention targets\n\n### Sexual Function Studies\n\nResearch into melanocortin effects on sexual behaviour:\n\n- **Erectile function** - Studies on central arousal mechanisms\n- **Female sexual function** - Research on desire and response pathways\n- **Receptor pharmacology** - Understanding MC4R role in sexual behaviour\n\n### Inflammatory Disease Models\n\nAnti-inflammatory properties are actively investigated:\n\n- **Arthritis models** -

This Исследовательский пептид has gained significant attention in scientific communities worldwide for its applications in metabolic research, particularly in studies related to type 2 diabetes and obesity. For comprehensive background information, see the [PubChem compound entry for Semaglutide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Semaglutide){:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"}.\n\nThe molecular Структура of Semaglutide features a unique C-18 fatty diacid chain attached to the lysine residue at position 26. This structural modification enables the Пептид to bind to serum albumin, dramatically extending its biological Период полураспада to approximately seven days. This prolonged activity profile makes Semaglutide an invaluable tool for researchers Исследованиеing sustained GLP-1 receptor activation mechanisms.\n\nПептид Shop supplies **research-grade Semaglutide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified by HPLC analysis and mass spectrometry. Every order includes a comprehensive Certificate of Analysis (COA), ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Semaglutide Work?\n\nSemaglutide exerts its biological effects through high-affinity binding to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in various tissues including pancreatic beta cells, the central nervous system, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. Upon receptor binding, Semaglutide initiates several downstream signalling cascades that researchers continue to investigate.\n\n### Pancreatic Effects\n\nIn pancreatic beta cells, GLP-1 receptor activation by Semaglutide triggers glucose-dependent insulin secretion through the cAMP-PKA signalling pathway. This glucose-dependent mechanism is particularly noteworthy in research, as it suggests reduced risk of hypoglycaemia compared to insulin secretagogues that work independently of glucose levels.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that Semaglutide may also promote beta-cell proliferation and reduce apoptosis in preКлинический models, suggesting potential applications in Исследованиеing beta-cell preservation strategies.\n\n### Central Nervous System Actions\n\nSemaglutide crosses the blood-brain barrier and activates GLP-1 receptors in key hypothalamic regions involved in appetite regulation, including the arcuate nucleus and paraventricular nucleus. Research indicates that this central action contributes to reduced food intake and altered food preferences in animal models.\n\nEmerging research also explores Semaglutide's potential neuroprotective properties, with studies investigating its effects in models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke.\n\n### Gastrointestinal Effects\n\nGLP-1 receptor activation slows gastric emptying, which may contribute to prolonged satiety and reduced postprandial glucose excursions. Researchers Исследованиеing gut-brain axis signalling find Semaglutide particularly useful for investigating these gastrointestinal regulatory mechanisms.\n\n## Research Applications of Semaglutide\n\n### Metabolic Research\n\nSemaglutide is extensively used in metabolic research laboratories Исследованиеing:\n\n- **Glucose homeostasis mechanisms** - Understanding how GLP-1 receptor activation influences blood glucose regulation\n- **Insulin secretion dynamics** - Investigating the molecular pathways governing glucose-dependent insulin release\n- **Beta-cell biology** - Исследованиеing potential regenerative and protective effects on pancreatic beta cells\n- **Glucagon suppression** - Researching the relationship between GLP-1 signalling and alpha-cell function\n\n### Weight Management Studies\n\nThe Пептид's effects on body weight have made it crucial for obesity research, including studies on:\n\n- **Appetite regulation** - Investigating central mechanisms controlling food intake and satiety\n- **Energy expenditure** - Исследованиеing metabolic rate changes associated with GLP-1 receptor activation\n- **Food preference alteration** - Researching how GLP-1 signalling affects dietary choices in animal models\n- **Adipose tissue biology** - Understanding effects on fat storage and metabolism\n\n### Cardiovascular Research\n\nEmerging evidence suggests GLP-1 receptor agonists may have cardiovascular effects beyond glucose control, leading to research investigating:\n\n- **Endothelial function** - Исследованиеing vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties\n- **Cardiac metabolism** - Investigating effects on myocardial glucose and fatty acid utilisation\n- **Atherosclerosis progression** - Researching potential anti-atherogenic mechanisms\n\n### Neuroscience Applications\n\nThe presence of GLP-1 receptors in the brain has sparked significant neuroscience research using Semaglutide:\n\n- **Neurodegeneration models** - Investigating potential protective effects in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models\n- **Stroke recovery** - Исследованиеing effects on neuronal survival and functional recovery\n- **Cognitive function** - Researching impacts on learning and memory in animal models\n\n## Semaglutide Пептид Specifications\n\nOur research-grade Semaglutide meets the highest quality standards required for reproducible scientific research:\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 910463-68-2 |\n| **Molecular Формула** | C₁₈₇H₂₉₁N₄₅O₅₉ |\n| **Молекулярная масса** | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Последовательность** | Modified GLP-1 (7-37) with Aib at position 8 and C-18 fatty diacid at Lys-26 |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Внешний вид** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in Вода at pH >7.0; slightly alkaline buffer recommended |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Протокол\n\nFor optimal Результаты in research applications, follow these reconstitution guidelines:\n\n1. **Allow the vial to reach room temperature** before opening to prevent moisture condensation on the lyophilised Пептид\n2. **Calculate the required concentration** for your research application\n3. **Use Стерильный bacteriostatic Вода** or a slightly alkaline buffer (pH 7.4-8.0) as the reconstitution vehicle\n4. **Add the solvent slowly** along the vial wall, not directly onto the Пептид\n5. **Gently swirl the vial** to dissolve - never shake vigorously as this may cause Пептид degradation\n6. **Ensure complete disРаствор** before aliquoting for experiments\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n| Condition | Storage Temperature | Recommended Duration |\n|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **восстановленный** | 2-8°C | Up to 4 weeks |\n| **Working aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 3 months |\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n- Protect from light during storage\n- Store in airtight containers to prevent moisture absorption\n- Use Стерильный technique during handling\n\n## Why Choose Пептид Shop for Semaglutide?\n\n### Guaranteed Purity\n\nEvery batch of our Semaglutide undergoes rigorous quality control testing.

This unique dual Механизм действия distinguishes Tirzepatide from single-target GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide, making it an invaluable tool for metabolic research.\n\nThe Пептид's Структура incorporates a modified GIP Последовательность with carefully engineered amino acid substitutions and a C20 fatty diacid side chain attached to lysine. This modification enables binding to serum albumin, extending the biological Период полураспада to approximately five days and allowing researchers to Исследование sustained dual receptor activation.\n\nПептид Shop supplies **research-grade Tirzepatide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis to ensure researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Tirzepatide Work?\n\nTirzepatide exerts its biological effects through simultaneous activation of GIP and GLP-1 receptors, both of which are G protein-coupled receptors expressed in various metabolically active tissues. This dual agonism creates synergistic signalling effects that researchers continue to characterise.\n\n### Dual Incretin Receptor Activation\n\nThe GIP receptor is predominantly expressed in pancreatic beta cells and adipose tissue, while GLP-1 receptors are found in pancreatic islets, brain, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. By activating both receptor systems simultaneously, Tirzepatide provides researchers with a unique tool for Исследованиеing:\n\n- **Synergistic insulin secretion** - Combined GIP and GLP-1 signalling enhances glucose-dependent insulin release beyond what either hormone achieves alone\n- **Enhanced metabolic effects** - Dual activation may improve insulin sensitivity through mechanisms distinct from single-agonist Пептидs\n- **Improved weight outcomes** - Research suggests the dual mechanism may provide superior Похудение effects compared to GLP-1 mono-agonists\n\n### Pancreatic Beta-Cell Effects\n\nIn pancreatic beta cells, Tirzepatide activates both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, leading to:\n\n- **Enhanced cAMP production** through dual receptor stimulation\n- **Improved glucose sensing** and insulin granule exocytosis\n- **Potential beta-cell protective effects** under metabolic stress conditions\n- **Reduced glucagon secretion** from pancreatic alpha cells\n\n### Central Nervous System Actions\n\nLike GLP-1 agonists, Tirzepatide affects appetite regulation through central mechanisms. Research indicates effects on:\n\n- **Hypothalamic appetite centres** - Modulating food intake signalling\n- **Reward pathway activity** - Potentially influencing food preferences\n- **Gastric emptying rates** - Contributing to prolonged satiety\n\n### Adipose Tissue Effects\n\nThe GIP receptor component may provide unique effects on adipose tissue:\n\n- **Enhanced lipid metabolism** - GIP signalling influences adipocyte function\n- **Improved insulin sensitivity** - Fat tissue-specific effects may contribute to metabolic improvements\n- **Altered adipokine secretion** - Potential effects on adiponectin and leptin\n\n## Research Applications of Tirzepatide\n\n### Comparative Incretin Research\n\nTirzepatide enables crucial comparative studies between:\n\n- Single GLP-1 receptor agonists vs dual GIP/GLP-1 agonism\n- GIP receptor-specific effects in metabolic regulation\n- Receptor selectivity profiles and their physiological conПоследовательностьs\n\n### Metabolic Syndrome Studies\n\nThe dual agonist is valuable for investigating:\n\n- **Multi-organ metabolic coordination** - Understanding how dual incretin signalling affects whole-body metabolism\n- **Insulin resistance mechanisms** - Исследованиеing potential improvements in peripheral insulin sensitivity\n- **Hepatic glucose production** - Investigating effects on liver metabolism\n\n### Weight Management Research\n\nTirzepatide's superior weight outcomes in preКлинический models make it essential for:\n\n- **Appetite regulation studies** - Comparing dual vs single agonist effects on food intake\n- **Energy expenditure research** - Investigating metabolic rate changes\n- **Adipose tissue biology** - Understanding fat mass reduction mechanisms\n\n### Cardiovascular Research\n\nEmerging areas of investigation include:\n\n- **Cardiac metabolism** - Effects on myocardial glucose and lipid utilisation\n- **Vascular function** - Potential endothelial effects of dual agonism\n- **Blood pressure regulation** - Understanding cardiovascular impacts\n\n### Diabetes Research\n\nCore applications in diabetes studies include:\n\n- **Beta-cell preservation** - Investigating protective effects on insulin-producing cells\n- **Glucose homeostasis** - Исследованиеing blood glucose regulation mechanisms\n- **Incretin physiology** - Understanding the incretin effect in normal and diabetic states\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide: Key Research Differences\n\n| Feature | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Receptor Targets** | GIP + GLP-1 (dual) | GLP-1 only |\n| **Период полураспада** | ~5 days | ~7 days |\n| **Молекулярная масса** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Fatty Acid Modification** | C20 diacid | C18 diacid |\n| **Research Focus** | Dual incretin synergy | GLP-1 specific mechanisms |\n\nBoth Пептидs are available from Пептид Shop in research-grade purity, allowing direct comparison studies.\n\n## Tirzepatide Пептид Specifications\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Molecular Формула** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Молекулярная масса** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Внешний вид** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in Вода; may require gentle warming |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Протокол\n\n1. **Equilibrate to room temperature** before opening the vial\n2. **Calculate required concentration** based on your experimental design\n3. **Add Стерильный bacteriostatic Вода** slowly along the vial wall\n4. **Gently swirl** to dissolve - avoid shaking\n5. **Allow complete disРаствор** before use\n6. **Aliquot immediately** to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n| Condition | Temperature | Duration |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **восстановленный** | 2-8°C | Up to 4 weeks |\n| **Working aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 3 months |\n\n## Why Choose Пептид Shop for Tirzepatide?\n\n### Verified Purity\n\nOur Tirzepatide undergoes rigorous quality testing with ≥99% purity verified by HPLC.
