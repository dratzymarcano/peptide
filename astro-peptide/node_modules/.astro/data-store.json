This makes it ideal for reconstituting lyophilized (freeze-dried) peptides for research applications where multiple withdrawals from the same vial are needed.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### USP Grade Quality\nOur bacteriostatic water meets United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for:\n- Sterility\n- Purity  \n- Benzyl alcohol concentration (0.9%)\n- Endotoxin levels\n\n### Multi-Use Design\nUnlike single-use sterile water, bacteriostatic water allows multiple withdrawals over several weeks without contamination risk, making it cost-effective for research laboratories.\n\n### Convenient 10ml Size\nEach 10ml vial can reconstitute 5-10 peptide vials depending on concentration requirements.\n\n## How to Use Bacteriostatic Water\n\n### Reconstitution Steps\n1. Allow the peptide vial to reach room temperature\n2. Clean both vial tops with an alcohol swab\n3. Using a sterile syringe, withdraw the desired amount of bacteriostatic water\n4. Insert the needle into the peptide vial, aiming at the glass wall\n5. Slowly inject the water, allowing it to run down the vial wall\n6. Gently swirl (do not shake) until fully dissolved\n7. Store reconstituted peptide at 2-8°C\n\n### Recommended Volumes\n| Peptide Amount | Suggested BAC Water | Concentration |\n|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n| 5mg | 1.0ml | 5mg/ml |\n| 5mg | 2.0ml | 2.5mg/ml |\n| 10mg | 2.0ml | 5mg/ml |\n| 10mg | 4.0ml | 2.5mg/ml |\n\n## Storage Instructions\n\n- **Unopened**: Store at room temperature (15-25°C), away from direct light\n- **Opened**: Use within 28 days\n- **Do not freeze**: Freezing may compromise sterility\n- **Shelf life**: 2 years from manufacture date\n\n## Applications in Research\n\nBacteriostatic water is essential for:\n- Peptide reconstitution for in vitro studies\n- Preparation of stock solutions\n- Multi-day research protocols requiring repeat sampling\n- Any application where sterility must be maintained over time\n\n## Comparison: Bacteriostatic vs Sterile Water\n\n| Feature | Bacteriostatic Water | Sterile Water |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------|\n| Preservative | 0.9% Benzyl Alcohol | None |\n| Multiple Uses | Yes (up to 28 days) | Single use only |\n| Bacterial Growth | Inhibited | Possible after opening |\n| Best For | Multi-dose peptides | Single-dose applications |\n\n## Quality Assurance\n\nEvery batch of our bacteriostatic water undergoes testing for:\n- **Sterility**: Tested per USP \u003C71>\n- **Endotoxins**: Tested per USP \u003C85>\n- **Particulate Matter**: Tested per USP \u003C788>\n- **Benzyl Alcohol Content**: Verified at 0.9% ± 0.05%\n\n## Related Products\n\n- [BPC-157](/peptides/buy-bpc-157) - Popular healing peptide\n- [TB-500](/peptides/buy-tb-500) - Recovery peptide\n- [Semaglutide](/peptides/buy-semaglutide) - GLP-1 agonist\n\n---\n\n*Bacteriostatic water is intended for research use only.

This synthetic peptide was specifically designed to isolate the fat-metabolising properties of growth hormone without its growth-promoting or diabetogenic effects.\n\nOriginally developed by Metabolic Pharmaceuticals in Australia, AOD-9604 represents one of the most targeted approaches to studying growth hormone's lipolytic activity. By using only the fat-reducing portion of the full hormone, researchers can investigate adipose tissue metabolism without confounding effects on IGF-1 or glucose homeostasis.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade AOD-9604** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis, ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does AOD-9604 Work?\n\nAOD-9604's mechanism of action centres on its ability to stimulate lipolysis and inhibit lipogenesis in adipose tissue, mimicking a specific subset of growth hormone's metabolic effects.\n\n### Lipolytic Activity\n\nThe peptide promotes fat breakdown through:\n- **Beta-3 adrenergic receptor interaction** - Research suggests enhancement of lipolytic signalling\n- **cAMP pathway activation** - Increased intracellular signalling in adipocytes\n- **Hormone-sensitive lipase activation** - Enhanced triglyceride breakdown\n- **Free fatty acid release** - Mobilisation of stored fat for oxidation\n\n### Anti-Lipogenic Effects\n\nAOD-9604 also inhibits fat accumulation:\n- **Reduced lipogenesis** - Decreased conversion of glucose to stored fat\n- **Adipocyte differentiation effects** - Research on fat cell maturation\n- **Metabolic enzyme modulation** - Effects on key lipid synthesis pathways\n\n### Selective Action\n\nA key research advantage is its selectivity:\n- **No IGF-1 elevation** - Unlike full growth hormone\n- **No glucose effects** - Preserved insulin sensitivity in research models\n- **No growth promotion** - Isolated metabolic effects\n- **Targeted adipose action** - Focus on fat tissue metabolism\n\n## Research Applications of AOD-9604\n\n### Fat Metabolism Studies\n\nPrimary research applications include:\n- **Lipolysis mechanisms** - Understanding fat breakdown pathways\n- **Lipogenesis inhibition** - Studying fat storage prevention\n- **Adipocyte biology** - Effects on fat cell function\n- **Comparative GH studies** - Fragment vs full hormone effects\n\n### Obesity Research\n\nThe peptide enables focused weight studies:\n- **Body composition effects** - Fat mass changes in models\n- **Visceral fat targeting** - Research on abdominal fat\n- **Energy balance** - Effects on metabolic homeostasis\n- **Combination approaches** - Synergy with other interventions\n\n### Metabolic Research\n\nBroader metabolic applications:\n- **Insulin sensitivity** - Studies confirming preserved glucose handling\n- **Lipid profiles** - Effects on circulating lipids\n- **Thermogenesis** - Potential energy expenditure effects\n\n## AOD-9604 Peptide Specifications\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 221231-10-3 |\n| **Molecular Formula** | C78H123N23O23S2 |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 1815.1 g/mol |\n| **Sequence** | Tyr-Leu-Arg-Ile-Val-Gln-Cys-Arg-Ser-Val-Glu-Gly-Ser-Cys-Gly-Phe |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Freely soluble in water |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling\n\n### Reconstitution Protocol\n\n1. **Equilibrate to room temperature** before opening\n2. **Add sterile bacteriostatic water** slowly along vial wall\n3. **Gently swirl** to dissolve - avoid shaking\n4. **Prepare aliquots** for longer storage\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n| Condition | Temperature | Duration |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | Up to 3-4 weeks |\n| **Frozen aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 3 months |\n\n## Why Choose Peptide Shop?\n\n### Guaranteed Purity\n- ≥99% purity by HPLC\n- Identity confirmation by mass spectrometry\n- Comprehensive COA documentation\n\n### UK-Based Delivery\n- Fast domestic shipping\n- Next-day option available\n- Temperature-controlled packaging\n\n## Ordering Information\n\n| Size | Recommended For |\n|------|-----------------|\n| **2 mg** | Pilot studies |\n| **5 mg** | Standard research |\n\n**Minimum order: £200** | **10% discount on orders over £200**\n\n## Research Use Statement\n\n**This product is sold exclusively for laboratory research purposes.** AOD-9604 from Peptide Shop is not intended for human or veterinary use.","src/content/products/aod-9604.md","1ec119cc4fad0ffd",{"html":312,"metadata":313},"\u003Ch2 id=\"what-is-aod-9604\">What is AOD-9604?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>AOD-9604\u003C/strong> (Anti-Obesity Drug 9604) is a modified fragment of human growth hormone comprising amino acids 177-191 of the C-terminal region, with an additional tyrosine residue at the N-terminus.

Originally developed at the University of Arizona in the 1980s, this research peptide has become an essential tool for studying melanocortin receptor signalling and the regulation of skin pigmentation.\n\nThe peptide's cyclic lactam structure provides enhanced stability and receptor binding affinity compared to linear α-MSH analogues. Melanotan 2 acts as a non-selective agonist at melanocortin receptors MC1, MC3, MC4, and MC5, enabling researchers to study diverse physiological processes beyond pigmentation.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Melanotan 2** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis, ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Melanotan 2 Work?\n\nMelanotan 2 exerts its biological effects through activation of melanocortin receptors, a family of G protein-coupled receptors that regulate diverse physiological processes. Understanding these mechanisms is central to ongoing research in dermatology, endocrinology, and neuroscience.\n\n### Melanocortin Receptor Family\n\nMT-2 activates multiple melanocortin receptor subtypes:\n\n- **MC1R** - Primarily expressed in melanocytes; regulates skin pigmentation\n- **MC3R** - Expressed in hypothalamus and peripheral tissues; involved in energy homeostasis\n- **MC4R** - Central nervous system expression; regulates appetite and sexual function\n- **MC5R** - Sebaceous glands and other tissues; less well characterised\n\n### Melanogenesis Pathway\n\nThe primary research application involves studying skin pigmentation:\n\n- **MC1R activation** - Triggers intracellular cAMP production in melanocytes\n- **MITF activation** - Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor upregulation\n- **Tyrosinase expression** - Key enzyme in melanin synthesis pathway\n- **Eumelanin production** - Brown-black pigment providing UV protection\n- **Melanosome transfer** - Distribution of pigment to keratinocytes\n\n### Central Nervous System Effects\n\nMT-2's non-selective receptor profile enables diverse CNS research:\n\n- **Appetite regulation** - MC4R activation in hypothalamus suppresses food intake\n- **Energy expenditure** - Effects on metabolic rate through central mechanisms\n- **Sexual behaviour** - Research on erectile function and libido in animal models\n- **Anxiolytic effects** - Studies on stress and anxiety-related behaviours\n\n### Anti-Inflammatory Research\n\nEmerging research explores melanocortin anti-inflammatory properties:\n\n- **Cytokine modulation** - Effects on inflammatory mediator production\n- **Immune cell function** - Research on macrophage and lymphocyte behaviour\n- **Tissue protection** - Studies on inflammation-related damage\n\n## Research Applications of Melanotan 2\n\n### Pigmentation Research\n\nMelanotan 2 is extensively used in dermatological research:\n\n- **Melanogenesis mechanisms** - Understanding pigment production pathways\n- **UV protection** - Research on natural photoprotection\n- **Vitiligo models** - Studies on repigmentation strategies\n- **Melanoma biology** - Understanding MC1R role in melanocyte transformation\n- **Skin ageing** - Research on photoprotection and pigmentary changes\n\n### Appetite and Obesity Research\n\nMC4R activation makes MT-2 valuable for metabolic studies:\n\n- **Food intake regulation** - Investigating central appetite control mechanisms\n- **Satiety signalling** - Research on post-prandial fullness pathways\n- **Energy homeostasis** - Studies on metabolic regulation\n- **Obesity models** - Investigating potential intervention targets\n\n### Sexual Function Studies\n\nResearch into melanocortin effects on sexual behaviour:\n\n- **Erectile function** - Studies on central arousal mechanisms\n- **Female sexual function** - Research on desire and response pathways\n- **Receptor pharmacology** - Understanding MC4R role in sexual behaviour\n\n### Inflammatory Disease Models\n\nAnti-inflammatory properties are actively investigated:\n\n- **Arthritis models** - Research on joint inflammation\n- **Inflammatory bowel disease** - Studies on gut inflammation\n- **Neuroinflammation** - Research on brain inflammatory conditions\n- **Tissue repair** - Investigating healing in inflammatory contexts\n\n### Skin Disorder Research\n\nDermatological applications extend beyond pigmentation:\n\n- **Photoprotection mechanisms** - Understanding skin UV defence\n- **Skin barrier function** - Research on epidermal integrity\n- **Wound healing** - Studies on melanocyte contribution to repair\n\n## Melanotan 2 vs Melanotan 1: Key Differences\n\nResearchers often compare these related peptides:\n\n| Feature | Melanotan 2 | Melanotan 1 |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Structure** | Cyclic heptapeptide | Linear tridecapeptide |\n| **Receptor Selectivity** | Non-selective (MC1/3/4/5) | MC1R selective |\n| **Research Focus** | Multiple applications | Pigmentation focused |\n| **CNS Effects** | Significant | Minimal |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 1024.2 g/mol | 1646.9 g/mol |\n| **Stability** | High (cyclic) | Moderate (linear) |\n\nBoth peptides are available from Peptide Shop for comparative research studies.\n\n## Melanotan 2 Peptide Specifications\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 121062-08-6 |\n| **Molecular Formula** | C₅₀H₆₉N₁₅O₉ |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 1024.2 g/mol |\n| **Sequence** | Ac-Nle-cyclo[Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-NH₂ |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Freely soluble in water |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Protocol\n\nMelanotan 2 is straightforward to prepare for research use:\n\n1. **Allow vial to reach room temperature** before opening\n2. **Calculate desired concentration** -

Peptide Shop delivers on quality, documentation, and customer service. Our new preferred supplier.","## What is Semaglutide?\n\n**Semaglutide** is a synthetic analogue of human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone naturally produced in the intestines that plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and appetite regulation. This research peptide has gained significant attention in scientific communities worldwide for its applications in metabolic research, particularly in studies related to type 2 diabetes and obesity. For comprehensive background information, see the [PubChem compound entry for Semaglutide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Semaglutide){:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"}.\n\nThe molecular structure of Semaglutide features a unique C-18 fatty diacid chain attached to the lysine residue at position 26. This structural modification enables the peptide to bind to serum albumin, dramatically extending its biological half-life to approximately seven days. This prolonged activity profile makes Semaglutide an invaluable tool for researchers studying sustained GLP-1 receptor activation mechanisms.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Semaglutide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified by HPLC analysis and mass spectrometry. Every order includes a comprehensive Certificate of Analysis (COA), ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Semaglutide Work?\n\nSemaglutide exerts its biological effects through high-affinity binding to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in various tissues including pancreatic beta cells, the central nervous system, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. Upon receptor binding, Semaglutide initiates several downstream signalling cascades that researchers continue to investigate.\n\n### Pancreatic Effects\n\nIn pancreatic beta cells, GLP-1 receptor activation by Semaglutide triggers glucose-dependent insulin secretion through the cAMP-PKA signalling pathway. This glucose-dependent mechanism is particularly noteworthy in research, as it suggests reduced risk of hypoglycaemia compared to insulin secretagogues that work independently of glucose levels.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that Semaglutide may also promote beta-cell proliferation and reduce apoptosis in preclinical models, suggesting potential applications in studying beta-cell preservation strategies.\n\n### Central Nervous System Actions\n\nSemaglutide crosses the blood-brain barrier and activates GLP-1 receptors in key hypothalamic regions involved in appetite regulation, including the arcuate nucleus and paraventricular nucleus. Research indicates that this central action contributes to reduced food intake and altered food preferences in animal models.\n\nEmerging research also explores Semaglutide's potential neuroprotective properties, with studies investigating its effects in models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke.\n\n### Gastrointestinal Effects\n\nGLP-1 receptor activation slows gastric emptying, which may contribute to prolonged satiety and reduced postprandial glucose excursions. Researchers studying gut-brain axis signalling find Semaglutide particularly useful for investigating these gastrointestinal regulatory mechanisms.\n\n## Research Applications of Semaglutide\n\n### Metabolic Research\n\nSemaglutide is extensively used in metabolic research laboratories studying:\n\n- **Glucose homeostasis mechanisms** - Understanding how GLP-1 receptor activation influences blood glucose regulation\n- **Insulin secretion dynamics** - Investigating the molecular pathways governing glucose-dependent insulin release\n- **Beta-cell biology** - Studying potential regenerative and protective effects on pancreatic beta cells\n- **Glucagon suppression** - Researching the relationship between GLP-1 signalling and alpha-cell function\n\n### Weight Management Studies\n\nThe peptide's effects on body weight have made it crucial for obesity research, including studies on:\n\n- **Appetite regulation** - Investigating central mechanisms controlling food intake and satiety\n- **Energy expenditure** - Studying metabolic rate changes associated with GLP-1 receptor activation\n- **Food preference alteration** - Researching how GLP-1 signalling affects dietary choices in animal models\n- **Adipose tissue biology** - Understanding effects on fat storage and metabolism\n\n### Cardiovascular Research\n\nEmerging evidence suggests GLP-1 receptor agonists may have cardiovascular effects beyond glucose control, leading to research investigating:\n\n- **Endothelial function** - Studying vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties\n- **Cardiac metabolism** - Investigating effects on myocardial glucose and fatty acid utilisation\n- **Atherosclerosis progression** - Researching potential anti-atherogenic mechanisms\n\n### Neuroscience Applications\n\nThe presence of GLP-1 receptors in the brain has sparked significant neuroscience research using Semaglutide:\n\n- **Neurodegeneration models** - Investigating potential protective effects in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models\n- **Stroke recovery** - Studying effects on neuronal survival and functional recovery\n- **Cognitive function** - Researching impacts on learning and memory in animal models\n\n## Semaglutide Peptide Specifications\n\nOur research-grade Semaglutide meets the highest quality standards required for reproducible scientific research:\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 910463-68-2 |\n| **Molecular Formula** | C₁₈₇H₂₉₁N₄₅O₅₉ |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Sequence** | Modified GLP-1 (7-37) with Aib at position 8 and C-18 fatty diacid at Lys-26 |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in water at pH >7.0; slightly alkaline buffer recommended |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Protocol\n\nFor optimal results in research applications, follow these reconstitution guidelines:\n\n1. **Allow the vial to reach room temperature** before opening to prevent moisture condensation on the lyophilised peptide\n2. **Calculate the required concentration** for your research application\n3. **Use sterile bacteriostatic water** or a slightly alkaline buffer (pH 7.4-8.0) as the reconstitution vehicle\n4. **Add the solvent slowly** along the vial wall, not directly onto the peptide\n5. **Gently swirl the vial** to dissolve - never shake vigorously as this may cause peptide degradation\n6. **Ensure complete dissolution** before aliquoting for experiments\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n| Condition | Storage Temperature | Recommended Duration |\n|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | Up to 4 weeks |\n| **Working aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 3 months |\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n- Protect from light during storage\n- Store in airtight containers to prevent moisture absorption\n- Use sterile technique during handling\n\n## Why Choose Peptide Shop for Semaglutide?\n\n### Guaranteed Purity\n\nEvery batch of our Semaglutide undergoes rigorous quality control testing.

This unique dual mechanism of action distinguishes Tirzepatide from single-target GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide, making it an invaluable tool for metabolic research.\n\nThe peptide's structure incorporates a modified GIP sequence with carefully engineered amino acid substitutions and a C20 fatty diacid side chain attached to lysine. This modification enables binding to serum albumin, extending the biological half-life to approximately five days and allowing researchers to study sustained dual receptor activation.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Tirzepatide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis to ensure researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Tirzepatide Work?\n\nTirzepatide exerts its biological effects through simultaneous activation of GIP and GLP-1 receptors, both of which are G protein-coupled receptors expressed in various metabolically active tissues. This dual agonism creates synergistic signalling effects that researchers continue to characterise.\n\n### Dual Incretin Receptor Activation\n\nThe GIP receptor is predominantly expressed in pancreatic beta cells and adipose tissue, while GLP-1 receptors are found in pancreatic islets, brain, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. By activating both receptor systems simultaneously, Tirzepatide provides researchers with a unique tool for studying:\n\n- **Synergistic insulin secretion** - Combined GIP and GLP-1 signalling enhances glucose-dependent insulin release beyond what either hormone achieves alone\n- **Enhanced metabolic effects** - Dual activation may improve insulin sensitivity through mechanisms distinct from single-agonist peptides\n- **Improved weight outcomes** - Research suggests the dual mechanism may provide superior weight loss effects compared to GLP-1 mono-agonists\n\n### Pancreatic Beta-Cell Effects\n\nIn pancreatic beta cells, Tirzepatide activates both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, leading to:\n\n- **Enhanced cAMP production** through dual receptor stimulation\n- **Improved glucose sensing** and insulin granule exocytosis\n- **Potential beta-cell protective effects** under metabolic stress conditions\n- **Reduced glucagon secretion** from pancreatic alpha cells\n\n### Central Nervous System Actions\n\nLike GLP-1 agonists, Tirzepatide affects appetite regulation through central mechanisms. Research indicates effects on:\n\n- **Hypothalamic appetite centres** - Modulating food intake signalling\n- **Reward pathway activity** - Potentially influencing food preferences\n- **Gastric emptying rates** - Contributing to prolonged satiety\n\n### Adipose Tissue Effects\n\nThe GIP receptor component may provide unique effects on adipose tissue:\n\n- **Enhanced lipid metabolism** - GIP signalling influences adipocyte function\n- **Improved insulin sensitivity** - Fat tissue-specific effects may contribute to metabolic improvements\n- **Altered adipokine secretion** - Potential effects on adiponectin and leptin\n\n## Research Applications of Tirzepatide\n\n### Comparative Incretin Research\n\nTirzepatide enables crucial comparative studies between:\n\n- Single GLP-1 receptor agonists vs dual GIP/GLP-1 agonism\n- GIP receptor-specific effects in metabolic regulation\n- Receptor selectivity profiles and their physiological consequences\n\n### Metabolic Syndrome Studies\n\nThe dual agonist is valuable for investigating:\n\n- **Multi-organ metabolic coordination** - Understanding how dual incretin signalling affects whole-body metabolism\n- **Insulin resistance mechanisms** - Studying potential improvements in peripheral insulin sensitivity\n- **Hepatic glucose production** - Investigating effects on liver metabolism\n\n### Weight Management Research\n\nTirzepatide's superior weight outcomes in preclinical models make it essential for:\n\n- **Appetite regulation studies** - Comparing dual vs single agonist effects on food intake\n- **Energy expenditure research** - Investigating metabolic rate changes\n- **Adipose tissue biology** - Understanding fat mass reduction mechanisms\n\n### Cardiovascular Research\n\nEmerging areas of investigation include:\n\n- **Cardiac metabolism** - Effects on myocardial glucose and lipid utilisation\n- **Vascular function** - Potential endothelial effects of dual agonism\n- **Blood pressure regulation** - Understanding cardiovascular impacts\n\n### Diabetes Research\n\nCore applications in diabetes studies include:\n\n- **Beta-cell preservation** - Investigating protective effects on insulin-producing cells\n- **Glucose homeostasis** - Studying blood glucose regulation mechanisms\n- **Incretin physiology** - Understanding the incretin effect in normal and diabetic states\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide: Key Research Differences\n\n| Feature | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Receptor Targets** | GIP + GLP-1 (dual) | GLP-1 only |\n| **Half-life** | ~5 days | ~7 days |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Fatty Acid Modification** | C20 diacid | C18 diacid |\n| **Research Focus** | Dual incretin synergy | GLP-1 specific mechanisms |\n\nBoth peptides are available from Peptide Shop in research-grade purity, allowing direct comparison studies.\n\n## Tirzepatide Peptide Specifications\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Molecular Formula** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in water; may require gentle warming |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Protocol\n\n1. **Equilibrate to room temperature** before opening the vial\n2. **Calculate required concentration** based on your experimental design\n3. **Add sterile bacteriostatic water** slowly along the vial wall\n4. **Gently swirl** to dissolve - avoid shaking\n5. **Allow complete dissolution** before use\n6. **Aliquot immediately** to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n| Condition | Temperature | Duration |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | Up to 4 weeks |\n| **Working aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 3 months |\n\n## Why Choose Peptide Shop for Tirzepatide?\n\n### Verified Purity\n\nOur Tirzepatide undergoes rigorous quality testing with ≥99% purity verified by HPLC.

Originally developed for neurodegenerative disease research, tesofensine has become an important tool for studying the neurological basis of appetite regulation and energy homeostasis.\n\nUnlike single-target compounds, tesofensine's triple mechanism enables researchers to investigate the complex interplay between monoaminergic systems in controlling food intake and metabolic rate. This makes it valuable for understanding the neuropharmacology of obesity and appetite disorders.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Tesofensine** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC analysis.\n\n## How Does Tesofensine Work?\n\nTesofensine increases synaptic concentrations of three key neurotransmitters:\n\n### Norepinephrine Effects\n- **Sympathetic activation** - Increased metabolic rate\n- **Appetite suppression** - Reduced hunger signalling\n- **Energy expenditure** - Enhanced thermogenesis\n- **Lipolysis promotion** - Fat mobilisation effects\n\n### Dopamine Effects\n- **Reward pathway modulation** - Altered food reward\n- **Motivation effects** - Changes in food-seeking behaviour\n- **Satiety enhancement** - Earlier meal termination\n- **Hedonic eating** - Reduced pleasure-driven consumption\n\n### Serotonin Effects\n- **Satiety signalling** - Enhanced fullness perception\n- **Mood effects** - Emotional eating modulation\n- **Carbohydrate preference** - Altered macronutrient choices\n\n## Research Applications\n\n### Obesity Research\n- **Appetite mechanisms** - Understanding hunger/satiety\n- **Energy balance** - Metabolic rate studies\n- **Feeding behaviour** - Food choice research\n\n### Neuroscience\n- **Monoamine systems** - Reuptake inhibition studies\n- **Receptor pharmacology** - Transporter research\n- **Behavioural neuroscience** - Motivation and reward\n\n## Specifications\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 402856-42-2 |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 382.5 g/mol |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White to off-white powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in DMSO, methanol |\n\n## Storage\n\nStore at room temperature, protected from light and moisture.\n\n## Ordering Information\n\n| Size | Price |\n|------|-------|\n| **10 mg** | From £42 |\n| **25 mg** | From £95 |\n\n**Minimum order: £200** | **10% discount on orders over £200**\n\n## Research Use Statement\n\n**For laboratory research only.** Not intended for human or veterinary use.","src/content/products/tesofensine.md","3480d8470a5f2989",{"html":3909,"metadata":3910},"\u003Ch2 id=\"what-is-tesofensine\">What is Tesofensine?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Tesofensine\u003C/strong> (NS2330) is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor that blocks the presynaptic reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin.

Metabolic Research | Peptide Shop","Explore the mechanisms and research applications of GLP-1 receptor agonists including Semaglutide and Tirzepatide.","## What Are GLP-1 Agonists?\n\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are a class of compounds that mimic the action of the naturally occurring incretin hormone GLP-1. These compounds have become essential tools in metabolic research, particularly in studies related to glucose homeostasis, appetite regulation, and energy metabolism.\n\n## The Science Behind GLP-1\n\nGLP-1 is released from intestinal L-cells in response to nutrient intake. It acts on multiple target tissues:\n\n### Pancreatic Effects\n- **Beta cells**: Enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion\n- **Alpha cells**: Suppresses glucagon release when glucose is elevated\n- **Delta cells**: May influence somatostatin secretion\n\n### Extra-Pancreatic Effects\n- **Central nervous system**: Reduces appetite and food intake\n- **Gastric effects**: Slows gastric emptying\n- **Cardiovascular**: Potential cardioprotective properties\n\n## Key GLP-1 Agonists in Research\n\n### Semaglutide\n\nSemaglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 analogue with 94% homology to native GLP-1. Key modifications include:\n\n- Amino acid substitution at position 8 (Aib) for DPP-4 resistance\n- Fatty acid chain attached to lysine at position 26 for albumin binding\n- Extended half-life (~1 week) enables weekly dosing in clinical settings\n\nResearch applications include:\n- Glucose homeostasis studies\n- Appetite and satiety research\n- Beta-cell function investigations\n- Cardiovascular outcome studies\n\n### Tirzepatide\n\nTirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist representing a new class of incretin-based compounds:\n\n- Activates both GIP and GLP-1 receptors\n- Demonstrates enhanced metabolic effects in preclinical models\n- Unique pharmacological profile for comparative studies\n\nResearch applications include:\n- Dual incretin signalling pathways\n- Comparative efficacy studies\n- Adipose tissue metabolism\n- Novel mechanism investigations\n\n## Research Considerations\n\nWhen working with GLP-1 agonists in research, consider:\n\n### Stability\n- Store lyophilised peptides at -20°C or below\n- Reconstituted solutions are stable for limited periods\n- Protect from repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n\n### Dosing\n- Start with published literature concentrations\n- Consider species-specific differences in receptor affinity\n- Account for the extended half-life in study design\n\n### Controls\n- Include appropriate vehicle controls\n- Consider using native GLP-1 as a comparator\n- Account for the glucose-dependent nature of effects\n\n## Emerging Research Areas\n\nCurrent research is exploring:\n\n- **Triple agonists**: Compounds targeting GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors\n- **Oral formulations**: Understanding absorption mechanisms\n- **Neurological effects**: GLP-1 receptors in the brain\n- **Combination approaches**: Synergistic effects with other pathways\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGLP-1 agonists represent a rapidly evolving area of metabolic research. Understanding their mechanisms and applications is essential for researchers studying glucose homeostasis, appetite regulation, and related metabolic pathways.\n\nFor research-grade GLP-1 agonists with guaranteed purity, explore our [Weight Loss Peptides collection](/peptides/weight-loss/).","src/content/blog/introduction-glp1-agonists-metabolic-research.md","04e4162133ac4346",{"html":3992,"metadata":3993},"\u003Ch2 id=\"what-are-glp-1-agonists\">What Are GLP-1 Agonists?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are a class of compounds that mimic the action of the naturally occurring incretin hormone GLP-1.

Proper storage techniques to maintain purity and extend shelf life.","## Why Proper Storage Matters\n\nPeptides are sensitive molecules that can degrade when exposed to heat, moisture, light, or oxygen. Proper storage is essential to maintain the purity and activity of your research compounds.\n\nFollowing these guidelines will help ensure your peptides remain stable throughout your research project.\n\n## Storing Lyophilised (Freeze-Dried) Peptides\n\nLyophilised peptides are the most stable form for storage. Here's how to keep them in optimal condition:\n\n### Temperature\n\n- **Short-term (weeks)**: Store at -20°C\n- **Long-term (months to years)**: Store at -80°C for maximum stability\n- **Avoid**: Repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n\n### Protection from Moisture\n\nLyophilised peptides are hygroscopic—they readily absorb moisture from the air. To prevent this:\n\n- Keep vials sealed until ready for use\n- Allow vials to reach room temperature before opening (prevents condensation)\n- Use desiccants in storage containers\n- Work quickly when the vial is open\n\n### Light Protection\n\nMany peptides are photosensitive. Store in:\n\n- Original amber vials (if provided)\n- Dark storage boxes or wrapped in foil\n- Refrigerators/freezers away from fluorescent lighting\n\n## Reconstituting Peptides\n\nWhen you're ready to use your peptides, follow these reconstitution guidelines:\n\n### Choosing a Solvent\n\n- **Bacteriostatic water** - Most common, suitable for most peptides\n- **Sterile water** - For single-use applications\n- **Acetic acid (0.1%)** - For basic peptides that are difficult to dissolve\n- **DMSO** - For hydrophobic peptides (use minimal volume)\n\n### Reconstitution Process\n\n1. Calculate the volume needed for your desired concentration\n2. Add solvent slowly down the side of the vial\n3. Gently swirl—never vortex or shake vigorously\n4. Allow to dissolve completely (may take several minutes)\n5. If cloudiness persists, a small amount of acetic acid may help\n\n## Storing Reconstituted Peptides\n\nOnce in solution, peptides are less stable than their lyophilised form:\n\n### Short-term Storage (Days to Weeks)\n\n- Store at 2-8°C (refrigerator)\n- Use within 2-4 weeks for most peptides\n- Check for precipitation or cloudiness before each use\n\n### Long-term Storage (Weeks to Months)\n\n- Aliquot into single-use portions to avoid freeze-thaw cycles\n- Store aliquots at -20°C or -80°C\n- Label clearly with date, concentration, and contents\n\n## Peptide-Specific Considerations\n\nSome peptides require special handling:\n\n### GHK-Cu (Copper Peptide)\n\n- Highly hygroscopic—extra care with moisture\n- Solutions are typically blue due to copper content\n- Stable in solution at 4°C for extended periods\n\n### Cysteine-Containing Peptides\n\n- Prone to oxidation—minimise air exposure\n- Consider adding reducing agents to solutions\n- Use argon or nitrogen to displace air in vials\n\n### Large Peptides (>30 amino acids)\n\n- More sensitive to aggregation\n- May require specific buffer conditions\n- Consider sterile filtration after reconstitution\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Storage Condition | Lyophilised | Reconstituted |\n|-------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Room temperature | Days (sealed) | Hours |\n| Refrigerator (4°C) | Weeks | 2-4 weeks |\n| Freezer (-20°C) | Months | 1-2 months |\n| Deep freezer (-80°C) | Years | 3-6 months |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nProper storage and handling of peptides is fundamental to successful research.

Learn what to look for in your Certificate of Analysis.","## What is HPLC and Why Does It Matter?\n\nHigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is the gold standard for determining peptide purity. When you purchase research peptides, the Certificate of Analysis (COA) typically includes an HPLC chromatogram that tells you exactly how pure your sample is.\n\nUnderstanding how to read these reports is essential for any researcher working with peptides.\n\n## Reading a Chromatogram\n\nAn HPLC chromatogram displays peaks that represent different compounds in your sample. Here's what to look for:\n\n### The Main Peak\n\nThe largest peak represents your target peptide. The area under this peak, expressed as a percentage of the total area of all peaks, gives you the purity value. At Peptide Shop, we guarantee ≥99% purity, meaning the main peak accounts for at least 99% of the total peak area.\n\n### Retention Time\n\nEach compound has a characteristic retention time—how long it takes to pass through the HPLC column. This helps identify the peptide and confirms you have the correct compound.\n\n### Impurity Peaks\n\nSmaller peaks represent impurities, which may include:\n\n- **Deletion sequences** - Peptides missing one or more amino acids\n- **Truncated sequences** - Shortened versions of the target peptide\n- **Oxidation products** - Oxidised forms of certain amino acids\n- **TFA or acetate salts** - Counter-ions from the synthesis process\n\n## What Purity Level Do You Need?\n\nDifferent research applications require different purity levels:\n\n- **≥95% purity** - Suitable for initial screening and some in vitro work\n- **≥98% purity** - Recommended for most research applications\n- **≥99% purity** - Required for quantitative studies and publication-quality research\n\nAt Peptide Shop, all our products meet the ≥99% purity standard to support rigorous research requirements.\n\n## Verifying Your COA\n\nWhen you receive your peptides, check the COA for:\n\n1. **Purity percentage** - Should match or exceed the stated purity\n2. **Retention time** - Should be consistent with the known value for that peptide\n3. **Clean baseline** - Minimal noise indicates quality analysis\n4. **Single main peak** - The target peptide should dominate the chromatogram\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding HPLC reports empowers you to make informed decisions about your research materials.

Here’s what to look for:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-main-peak\">The Main Peak\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The largest peak represents your target peptide. The area under this peak, expressed as a percentage of the total area of all peaks, gives you the purity value. At Peptide Shop, we guarantee ≥99% purity, meaning the main peak accounts for at least 99% of the total peak area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"retention-time\">Retention Time\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Each compound has a characteristic retention time—how long it takes to pass through the HPLC column.
