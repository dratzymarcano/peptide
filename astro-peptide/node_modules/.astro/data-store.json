When you purchase research peptides, the Certificate of Analysis (COA) typically includes an HPLC chromatogram that tells you exactly how pure your sample is.\n\nUnderstanding how to read these reports is essential for any researcher working with peptides.\n\n## Reading a Chromatogram\n\nAn HPLC chromatogram displays peaks that represent different compounds in your sample. Here's what to look for:\n\n### The Main Peak\n\nThe largest peak represents your target peptide. The area under this peak, expressed as a percentage of the total area of all peaks, gives you the purity value. At Peptide Shop, we guarantee ≥99% purity, meaning the main peak accounts for at least 99% of the total peak area.\n\n### Retention Time\n\nEach compound has a characteristic retention time—how long it takes to pass through the HPLC column. This helps identify the peptide and confirms you have the correct compound.\n\n### Impurity Peaks\n\nSmaller peaks represent impurities, which may include:\n\n- **Deletion sequences** - Peptides missing one or more amino acids\n- **Truncated sequences** - Shortened versions of the target peptide\n- **Oxidation products** - Oxidised forms of certain amino acids\n- **TFA or acetate salts** - Counter-ions from the synthesis process\n\n## What Purity Level Do You Need?\n\nDifferent research applications require different purity levels:\n\n- **≥95% purity** - Suitable for initial screening and some in vitro work\n- **≥98% purity** - Recommended for most research applications\n- **≥99% purity** - Required for quantitative studies and publication-quality research\n\nAt Peptide Shop, all our products meet the ≥99% purity standard to support rigorous research requirements.\n\n## Verifying Your COA\n\nWhen you receive your peptides, check the COA for:\n\n1. **Purity percentage** - Should match or exceed the stated purity\n2. **Retention time** - Should be consistent with the known value for that peptide\n3. **Clean baseline** - Minimal noise indicates quality analysis\n4. **Single main peak** - The target peptide should dominate the chromatogram\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding HPLC reports empowers you to make informed decisions about your research materials.

Proper storage techniques to maintain purity and extend shelf life.","## Why Proper Storage Matters\n\nPeptides are sensitive molecules that can degrade when exposed to heat, moisture, light, or oxygen. Proper storage is essential to maintain the purity and activity of your research compounds.\n\nFollowing these guidelines will help ensure your peptides remain stable throughout your research project.\n\n## Storing Lyophilised (Freeze-Dried) Peptides\n\nLyophilised peptides are the most stable form for storage. Here's how to keep them in optimal condition:\n\n### Temperature\n\n- **Short-term (weeks)**: Store at -20°C\n- **Long-term (months to years)**: Store at -80°C for maximum stability\n- **Avoid**: Repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n\n### Protection from Moisture\n\nLyophilised peptides are hygroscopic—they readily absorb moisture from the air. To prevent this:\n\n- Keep vials sealed until ready for use\n- Allow vials to reach room temperature before opening (prevents condensation)\n- Use desiccants in storage containers\n- Work quickly when the vial is open\n\n### Light Protection\n\nMany peptides are photosensitive. Store in:\n\n- Original amber vials (if provided)\n- Dark storage boxes or wrapped in foil\n- Refrigerators/freezers away from fluorescent lighting\n\n## Reconstituting Peptides\n\nWhen you're ready to use your peptides, follow these reconstitution guidelines:\n\n### Choosing a Solvent\n\n- **Bacteriostatic water** - Most common, suitable for most peptides\n- **Sterile water** - For single-use applications\n- **Acetic acid (0.1%)** - For basic peptides that are difficult to dissolve\n- **DMSO** - For hydrophobic peptides (use minimal volume)\n\n### Reconstitution Process\n\n1. Calculate the volume needed for your desired concentration\n2. Add solvent slowly down the side of the vial\n3. Gently swirl—never vortex or shake vigorously\n4. Allow to dissolve completely (may take several minutes)\n5. If cloudiness persists, a small amount of acetic acid may help\n\n## Storing Reconstituted Peptides\n\nOnce in solution, peptides are less stable than their lyophilised form:\n\n### Short-term Storage (Days to Weeks)\n\n- Store at 2-8°C (refrigerator)\n- Use within 2-4 weeks for most peptides\n- Check for precipitation or cloudiness before each use\n\n### Long-term Storage (Weeks to Months)\n\n- Aliquot into single-use portions to avoid freeze-thaw cycles\n- Store aliquots at -20°C or -80°C\n- Label clearly with date, concentration, and contents\n\n## Peptide-Specific Considerations\n\nSome peptides require special handling:\n\n### GHK-Cu (Copper Peptide)\n\n- Highly hygroscopic—extra care with moisture\n- Solutions are typically blue due to copper content\n- Stable in solution at 4°C for extended periods\n\n### Cysteine-Containing Peptides\n\n- Prone to oxidation—minimise air exposure\n- Consider adding reducing agents to solutions\n- Use argon or nitrogen to displace air in vials\n\n### Large Peptides (>30 amino acids)\n\n- More sensitive to aggregation\n- May require specific buffer conditions\n- Consider sterile filtration after reconstitution\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Storage Condition | Lyophilised | Reconstituted |\n|-------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Room temperature | Days (sealed) | Hours |\n| Refrigerator (4°C) | Weeks | 2-4 weeks |\n| Freezer (-20°C) | Months | 1-2 months |\n| Deep freezer (-80°C) | Years | 3-6 months |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nProper storage and handling of peptides is fundamental to successful research.

Dies macht es ideal für die Rekonstitution von lyophilisierten (gefriergetrockneten) Peptiden für Forschungsanwendungen, bei denen mehrere Entnahmen aus demselben Fläschchen erforderlich sind.\n\n## Hauptmerkmale\n\n### USP Qualität\nUnser bakteriostatisches Wasser erfüllt United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Standards für:\n- Sterilität\n- Reinheit  \n- Benzylalkohol-Konzentration (0,9%)\n- Endotoxin-Werte\n\n### Mehrfachverwendungs-Design\nIm Gegensatz zu sterilem Wasser für den Einmalgebrauch ermöglicht bakteriostatisches Wasser mehrere Entnahmen über mehrere Wochen ohne Kontaminationsrisiko, was es kostengünstig für Forschungslabore macht.\n\n### Praktische 10ml Größe\nJedes 10ml Fläschchen kann je nach Konzentrationsanforderungen 5-10 Peptid-Fläschchen rekonstituieren.\n\n## Wie man Bakteriostatisches Wasser Verwendet\n\n### Rekonstitutionsschritte\n1. Lassen Sie das Peptid-Fläschchen Raumtemperatur erreichen\n2. Reinigen Sie beide Fläschchendeckel mit einem Alkoholtupfer\n3. Entnehmen Sie mit einer sterilen Spritze die gewünschte Menge bakteriostatisches Wasser\n4. Führen Sie die Nadel in das Peptid-Fläschchen ein, auf die Glaswand gerichtet\n5. Injizieren Sie das Wasser langsam, sodass es an der Fläschchenwand herunterläuft\n6. Vorsichtig schwenken (nicht schütteln) bis vollständig aufgelöst\n7.

This synthetic peptide was specifically designed to isolate the fat-metabolising properties of growth hormone without its growth-promoting or diabetogenic effects.\n\nOriginally developed by Metabolic Pharmaceuticals in Australia, AOD-9604 represents one of the most targeted approaches to studying growth hormone's lipolytic activity. By using only the fat-reducing portion of the full hormone, researchers can investigate adipose tissue metabolism without confounding effects on IGF-1 or glucose homeostasis.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade AOD-9604** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis.

Unverzichtbar für unsere Inkretin-Mechanismus-Studien.","## Was ist Tirzepatide?\n\n**Tirzepatide** ist ein neuartiges synthetisches Peptid, das als dualer Agonist von zwei wichtigen Inkretin-Hormonrezeptoren fungiert: glukoseabhängiges insulinotropes Polypeptid (GIP) und glucagon-ähnliches Peptid-1 (GLP-1). Dieser einzigartige duale Wirkmechanismus unterscheidet Tirzepatide von Single-Target GLP-1-Rezeptoragonisten wie Semaglutide und macht es zu einem unverzichtbaren Werkzeug für die Stoffwechselforschung.\n\nDie Peptidstruktur enthält eine modifizierte GIP-Sequenz mit sorgfältig entwickelten Aminosäuresubstitutionen und einer C20-Fettsäure-Diacid-Seitenkette, die an Lysin angebracht ist. Diese Modifikation ermöglicht die Bindung an Serumalbumin, wodurch die biologische Halbwertszeit auf etwa fünf Tage verlängert wird und Forscher anhaltende duale Rezeptoraktivierung untersuchen können.\n\nPeptide Shop liefert **Forschungsqualität Tirzepatide** mit garantierter ≥99% Reinheit, verifiziert durch umfassende HPLC- und Massenspektrometrie-Analyse. Jede Bestellung enthält ein detailliertes Analysezertifikat, um sicherzustellen, dass Forscher ordnungsgemäß charakterisiertes Material für ihre Studien erhalten.\n\n## Wie funktioniert Tirzepatide?\n\nTirzepatide übt seine biologischen Wirkungen durch gleichzeitige Aktivierung von GIP- und GLP-1-Rezeptoren aus, die beide G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptoren sind, die in verschiedenen metabolisch aktiven Geweben exprimiert werden. Dieser duale Agonismus erzeugt synergistische Signaleffekte, die Forscher weiter charakterisieren.\n\n### Duale Inkretin-Rezeptor-Aktivierung\n\nDer GIP-Rezeptor wird hauptsächlich in pankreatischen Betazellen und Fettgewebe exprimiert, während GLP-1-Rezeptoren in Pankreasinseln, Gehirn, Herz und Magen-Darm-Trakt zu finden sind. Durch die gleichzeitige Aktivierung beider Rezeptorsysteme bietet Tirzepatide Forschern ein einzigartiges Werkzeug zur Untersuchung von:\n\n- **Synergistische Insulinsekretion** - Kombinierte GIP- und GLP-1-Signalübertragung verstärkt die glukoseabhängige Insulinfreisetzung über das hinaus, was jedes Hormon allein erreicht\n- **Verbesserte metabolische Effekte** - Duale Aktivierung kann die Insulinsensitivität durch Mechanismen verbessern, die sich von Einzelagonisten-Peptiden unterscheiden\n- **Verbesserte Gewichtsergebnisse** - Forschung legt nahe, dass der duale Mechanismus überlegene Gewichtsverlusteffekte im Vergleich zu GLP-1-Monoagonisten bieten kann\n\n## Forschungsanwendungen von Tirzepatide\n\n### Vergleichende Inkretin-Forschung\n\nTirzepatide ermöglicht entscheidende Vergleichsstudien zwischen:\n\n- Einzelne GLP-1-Rezeptoragonisten vs. dualer GIP/GLP-1 Agonismus\n- GIP-Rezeptor-spezifische Effekte in der metabolischen Regulation\n- Rezeptorselektivitätsprofile und ihre physiologischen Konsequenzen\n\n### Metabolisches Syndrom Studien\n\nDer duale Agonist ist wertvoll für die Untersuchung von:\n\n- **Multi-Organ metabolische Koordination** - Verstehen, wie duale Inkretin-Signalübertragung den Gesamtkörperstoffwechsel beeinflusst\n- **Insulinresistenz-Mechanismen** - Untersuchung potenzieller Verbesserungen der peripheren Insulinsensitivität\n- **Hepatische Glukoseproduktion** - Untersuchung der Auswirkungen auf den Leberstoffwechsel\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide: Wichtige Forschungsunterschiede\n\n| Merkmal | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Rezeptor-Ziele** | GIP + GLP-1 (dual) | Nur GLP-1 |\n| **Halbwertszeit** | ~5 Tage | ~7 Tage |\n| **Molekulargewicht** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Fettsäure-Modifikation** | C20 Diacid | C18 Diacid |\n| **Forschungsfokus** | Duale Inkretin-Synergie | GLP-1 spezifische Mechanismen |\n\n## Tirzepatide Peptid Spezifikationen\n\n| Spezifikation | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS-Nummer** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Molekularformel** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Molekulargewicht** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Reinheit** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Aussehen** | Weißes bis cremefarbenes lyophilisiertes Pulver |\n| **Löslichkeit** | Löslich in Wasser; kann sanftes Erwärmen erfordern |\n| **Identität** | Bestätigt durch Massenspektrometrie |\n\n## Warum Peptide Shop für Tirzepatide wählen?\n\n### Verifizierte Reinheit\n\nUnser Tirzepatide durchläuft strenge Qualitätsprüfungen mit ≥99% Reinheit, verifiziert durch HPLC.

This makes it ideal for reconstituting lyophilized (freeze-dried) peptides for research applications where multiple withdrawals from the same vial are needed.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### USP Grade Quality\nOur bacteriostatic water meets United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for:\n- Sterility\n- Purity  \n- Benzyl alcohol concentration (0.9%)\n- Endotoxin levels\n\n### Multi-Use Design\nUnlike single-use sterile water, bacteriostatic water allows multiple withdrawals over several weeks without contamination risk, making it cost-effective for research laboratories.\n\n### Convenient 10ml Size\nEach 10ml vial can reconstitute 5-10 peptide vials depending on concentration requirements.\n\n## How to Use Bacteriostatic Water\n\n### Reconstitution Steps\n1. Allow the peptide vial to reach room temperature\n2. Clean both vial tops with an alcohol swab\n3. Using a sterile syringe, withdraw the desired amount of bacteriostatic water\n4. Insert the needle into the peptide vial, aiming at the glass wall\n5. Slowly inject the water, allowing it to run down the vial wall\n6. Gently swirl (do not shake) until fully dissolved\n7. Store reconstituted peptide at 2-8°C\n\n### Recommended Volumes\n| Peptide Amount | Suggested BAC Water | Concentration |\n|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n| 5mg | 1.0ml | 5mg/ml |\n| 5mg | 2.0ml | 2.5mg/ml |\n| 10mg | 2.0ml | 5mg/ml |\n| 10mg | 4.0ml | 2.5mg/ml |\n\n## Storage Instructions\n\n- **Unopened**: Store at room temperature (15-25°C), away from direct light\n- **Opened**: Use within 28 days\n- **Do not freeze**: Freezing may compromise sterility\n- **Shelf life**: 2 years from manufacture date\n\n## Applications in Research\n\nBacteriostatic water is essential for:\n- Peptide reconstitution for in vitro studies\n- Preparation of stock solutions\n- Multi-day research protocols requiring repeat sampling\n- Any application where sterility must be maintained over time\n\n## Comparison: Bacteriostatic vs Sterile Water\n\n| Feature | Bacteriostatic Water | Sterile Water |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------|\n| Preservative | 0.9% Benzyl Alcohol | None |\n| Multiple Uses | Yes (up to 28 days) | Single use only |\n| Bacterial Growth | Inhibited | Possible after opening |\n| Best For | Multi-dose peptides | Single-dose applications |\n\n## Quality Assurance\n\nEvery batch of our bacteriostatic water undergoes testing for:\n- **Sterility**: Tested per USP \u003C71>\n- **Endotoxins**: Tested per USP \u003C85>\n- **Particulate Matter**: Tested per USP \u003C788>\n- **Benzyl Alcohol Content**: Verified at 0.9% ± 0.05%\n\n## Related Products\n\n- [BPC-157](/peptides/buy-bpc-157) - Popular healing peptide\n- [TB-500](/peptides/buy-tb-500) - Recovery peptide\n- [Semaglutide](/peptides/buy-semaglutide) - GLP-1 agonist\n\n---\n\n*Bacteriostatic water is intended for research use only.

This unprecedented triple mechanism of action makes Retatrutide the most comprehensive incretin-based research tool currently available.\n\nThe peptide represents the next evolution beyond dual agonists like tirzepatide, adding glucagon receptor activation to the established GLP-1/GIP dual agonism. This triple receptor engagement enables researchers to study the complex interplay between these metabolic signalling systems and their combined effects on glucose homeostasis, energy expenditure, and body weight regulation.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Retatrutide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis.

Peptide Shop delivers on quality, documentation, and customer service. Our new preferred supplier.","## What is Semaglutide?\n\n**Semaglutide** is a synthetic analogue of human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone naturally produced in the intestines that plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and appetite regulation. This research peptide has gained significant attention in scientific communities worldwide for its applications in metabolic research, particularly in studies related to type 2 diabetes and obesity. For comprehensive background information, see the [PubChem compound entry for Semaglutide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Semaglutide){:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"}.\n\nThe molecular structure of Semaglutide features a unique C-18 fatty diacid chain attached to the lysine residue at position 26. This structural modification enables the peptide to bind to serum albumin, dramatically extending its biological half-life to approximately seven days. This prolonged activity profile makes Semaglutide an invaluable tool for researchers studying sustained GLP-1 receptor activation mechanisms.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Semaglutide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified by HPLC analysis and mass spectrometry. Every order includes a comprehensive Certificate of Analysis (COA), ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Semaglutide Work?\n\nSemaglutide exerts its biological effects through high-affinity binding to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in various tissues including pancreatic beta cells, the central nervous system, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. Upon receptor binding, Semaglutide initiates several downstream signalling cascades that researchers continue to investigate.\n\n### Pancreatic Effects\n\nIn pancreatic beta cells, GLP-1 receptor activation by Semaglutide triggers glucose-dependent insulin secretion through the cAMP-PKA signalling pathway. This glucose-dependent mechanism is particularly noteworthy in research, as it suggests reduced risk of hypoglycaemia compared to insulin secretagogues that work independently of glucose levels.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that Semaglutide may also promote beta-cell proliferation and reduce apoptosis in preclinical models, suggesting potential applications in studying beta-cell preservation strategies.\n\n### Central Nervous System Actions\n\nSemaglutide crosses the blood-brain barrier and activates GLP-1 receptors in key hypothalamic regions involved in appetite regulation, including the arcuate nucleus and paraventricular nucleus. Research indicates that this central action contributes to reduced food intake and altered food preferences in animal models.\n\nEmerging research also explores Semaglutide's potential neuroprotective properties, with studies investigating its effects in models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke.\n\n### Gastrointestinal Effects\n\nGLP-1 receptor activation slows gastric emptying, which may contribute to prolonged satiety and reduced postprandial glucose excursions. Researchers studying gut-brain axis signalling find Semaglutide particularly useful for investigating these gastrointestinal regulatory mechanisms.\n\n## Research Applications of Semaglutide\n\n### Metabolic Research\n\nSemaglutide is extensively used in metabolic research laboratories studying:\n\n- **Glucose homeostasis mechanisms** - Understanding how GLP-1 receptor activation influences blood glucose regulation\n- **Insulin secretion dynamics** - Investigating the molecular pathways governing glucose-dependent insulin release\n- **Beta-cell biology** - Studying potential regenerative and protective effects on pancreatic beta cells\n- **Glucagon suppression** - Researching the relationship between GLP-1 signalling and alpha-cell function\n\n### Weight Management Studies\n\nThe peptide's effects on body weight have made it crucial for obesity research, including studies on:\n\n- **Appetite regulation** - Investigating central mechanisms controlling food intake and satiety\n- **Energy expenditure** - Studying metabolic rate changes associated with GLP-1 receptor activation\n- **Food preference alteration** - Researching how GLP-1 signalling affects dietary choices in animal models\n- **Adipose tissue biology** - Understanding effects on fat storage and metabolism\n\n### Cardiovascular Research\n\nEmerging evidence suggests GLP-1 receptor agonists may have cardiovascular effects beyond glucose control, leading to research investigating:\n\n- **Endothelial function** - Studying vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties\n- **Cardiac metabolism** - Investigating effects on myocardial glucose and fatty acid utilisation\n- **Atherosclerosis progression** - Researching potential anti-atherogenic mechanisms\n\n### Neuroscience Applications\n\nThe presence of GLP-1 receptors in the brain has sparked significant neuroscience research using Semaglutide:\n\n- **Neurodegeneration models** - Investigating potential protective effects in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models\n- **Stroke recovery** - Studying effects on neuronal survival and functional recovery\n- **Cognitive function** - Researching impacts on learning and memory in animal models\n\n## Semaglutide Peptide Specifications\n\nOur research-grade Semaglutide meets the highest quality standards required for reproducible scientific research:\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 910463-68-2 |\n| **Molecular Formula** | C₁₈₇H₂₉₁N₄₅O₅₉ |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Sequence** | Modified GLP-1 (7-37) with Aib at position 8 and C-18 fatty diacid at Lys-26 |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in water at pH >7.0; slightly alkaline buffer recommended |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Protocol\n\nFor optimal results in research applications, follow these reconstitution guidelines:\n\n1. **Allow the vial to reach room temperature** before opening to prevent moisture condensation on the lyophilised peptide\n2. **Calculate the required concentration** for your research application\n3. **Use sterile bacteriostatic water** or a slightly alkaline buffer (pH 7.4-8.0) as the reconstitution vehicle\n4. **Add the solvent slowly** along the vial wall, not directly onto the peptide\n5. **Gently swirl the vial** to dissolve - never shake vigorously as this may cause peptide degradation\n6. **Ensure complete dissolution** before aliquoting for experiments\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n| Condition | Storage Temperature | Recommended Duration |\n|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | Up to 4 weeks |\n| **Working aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 3 months |\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n- Protect from light during storage\n- Store in airtight containers to prevent moisture absorption\n- Use sterile technique during handling\n\n## Why Choose Peptide Shop for Semaglutide?\n\n### Guaranteed Purity\n\nEvery batch of our Semaglutide undergoes rigorous quality control testing.

This unique dual mechanism of action distinguishes Tirzepatide from single-target GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide, making it an invaluable tool for metabolic research.\n\nThe peptide's structure incorporates a modified GIP sequence with carefully engineered amino acid substitutions and a C20 fatty diacid side chain attached to lysine. This modification enables binding to serum albumin, extending the biological half-life to approximately five days and allowing researchers to study sustained dual receptor activation.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Tirzepatide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis to ensure researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Tirzepatide Work?\n\nTirzepatide exerts its biological effects through simultaneous activation of GIP and GLP-1 receptors, both of which are G protein-coupled receptors expressed in various metabolically active tissues. This dual agonism creates synergistic signalling effects that researchers continue to characterise.\n\n### Dual Incretin Receptor Activation\n\nThe GIP receptor is predominantly expressed in pancreatic beta cells and adipose tissue, while GLP-1 receptors are found in pancreatic islets, brain, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. By activating both receptor systems simultaneously, Tirzepatide provides researchers with a unique tool for studying:\n\n- **Synergistic insulin secretion** - Combined GIP and GLP-1 signalling enhances glucose-dependent insulin release beyond what either hormone achieves alone\n- **Enhanced metabolic effects** - Dual activation may improve insulin sensitivity through mechanisms distinct from single-agonist peptides\n- **Improved weight outcomes** - Research suggests the dual mechanism may provide superior weight loss effects compared to GLP-1 mono-agonists\n\n### Pancreatic Beta-Cell Effects\n\nIn pancreatic beta cells, Tirzepatide activates both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, leading to:\n\n- **Enhanced cAMP production** through dual receptor stimulation\n- **Improved glucose sensing** and insulin granule exocytosis\n- **Potential beta-cell protective effects** under metabolic stress conditions\n- **Reduced glucagon secretion** from pancreatic alpha cells\n\n### Central Nervous System Actions\n\nLike GLP-1 agonists, Tirzepatide affects appetite regulation through central mechanisms. Research indicates effects on:\n\n- **Hypothalamic appetite centres** - Modulating food intake signalling\n- **Reward pathway activity** - Potentially influencing food preferences\n- **Gastric emptying rates** - Contributing to prolonged satiety\n\n### Adipose Tissue Effects\n\nThe GIP receptor component may provide unique effects on adipose tissue:\n\n- **Enhanced lipid metabolism** - GIP signalling influences adipocyte function\n- **Improved insulin sensitivity** - Fat tissue-specific effects may contribute to metabolic improvements\n- **Altered adipokine secretion** - Potential effects on adiponectin and leptin\n\n## Research Applications of Tirzepatide\n\n### Comparative Incretin Research\n\nTirzepatide enables crucial comparative studies between:\n\n- Single GLP-1 receptor agonists vs dual GIP/GLP-1 agonism\n- GIP receptor-specific effects in metabolic regulation\n- Receptor selectivity profiles and their physiological consequences\n\n### Metabolic Syndrome Studies\n\nThe dual agonist is valuable for investigating:\n\n- **Multi-organ metabolic coordination** - Understanding how dual incretin signalling affects whole-body metabolism\n- **Insulin resistance mechanisms** - Studying potential improvements in peripheral insulin sensitivity\n- **Hepatic glucose production** - Investigating effects on liver metabolism\n\n### Weight Management Research\n\nTirzepatide's superior weight outcomes in preclinical models make it essential for:\n\n- **Appetite regulation studies** - Comparing dual vs single agonist effects on food intake\n- **Energy expenditure research** - Investigating metabolic rate changes\n- **Adipose tissue biology** - Understanding fat mass reduction mechanisms\n\n### Cardiovascular Research\n\nEmerging areas of investigation include:\n\n- **Cardiac metabolism** - Effects on myocardial glucose and lipid utilisation\n- **Vascular function** - Potential endothelial effects of dual agonism\n- **Blood pressure regulation** - Understanding cardiovascular impacts\n\n### Diabetes Research\n\nCore applications in diabetes studies include:\n\n- **Beta-cell preservation** - Investigating protective effects on insulin-producing cells\n- **Glucose homeostasis** - Studying blood glucose regulation mechanisms\n- **Incretin physiology** - Understanding the incretin effect in normal and diabetic states\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide: Key Research Differences\n\n| Feature | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Receptor Targets** | GIP + GLP-1 (dual) | GLP-1 only |\n| **Half-life** | ~5 days | ~7 days |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Fatty Acid Modification** | C20 diacid | C18 diacid |\n| **Research Focus** | Dual incretin synergy | GLP-1 specific mechanisms |\n\nBoth peptides are available from Peptide Shop in research-grade purity, allowing direct comparison studies.\n\n## Tirzepatide Peptide Specifications\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Molecular Formula** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in water; may require gentle warming |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Protocol\n\n1. **Equilibrate to room temperature** before opening the vial\n2. **Calculate required concentration** based on your experimental design\n3. **Add sterile bacteriostatic water** slowly along the vial wall\n4. **Gently swirl** to dissolve - avoid shaking\n5. **Allow complete dissolution** before use\n6. **Aliquot immediately** to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n| Condition | Temperature | Duration |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | Up to 4 weeks |\n| **Working aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 3 months |\n\n## Why Choose Peptide Shop for Tirzepatide?\n\n### Verified Purity\n\nOur Tirzepatide undergoes rigorous quality testing with ≥99% purity verified by HPLC.

Esto la hace ideal para reconstituir péptidos liofilizados (secados por congelación) para aplicaciones de investigación donde se necesitan múltiples extracciones del mismo vial.\n\n## Características Principales\n\n### Calidad USP\nNuestra agua bacteriostática cumple con los estándares United States Pharmacopeia (USP) para:\n- Esterilidad\n- Pureza  \n- Concentración de alcohol bencílico (0,9%)\n- Niveles de endotoxinas\n\n### Diseño Multi-Uso\nA diferencia del agua estéril de un solo uso, el agua bacteriostática permite múltiples extracciones durante varias semanas sin riesgo de contaminación, haciéndola rentable para laboratorios de investigación.\n\n### Tamaño Conveniente de 10ml\nCada vial de 10ml puede reconstituir 5-10 viales de péptidos dependiendo de los requisitos de concentración.\n\n## Cómo Usar el Agua Bacteriostática\n\n### Pasos de Reconstitución\n1. Permitir que el vial de péptido alcance temperatura ambiente\n2. Limpiar ambas tapas de vial con una toallita de alcohol\n3. Usando una jeringa estéril, extraer la cantidad deseada de agua bacteriostática\n4. Insertar la aguja en el vial de péptido, apuntando a la pared de vidrio\n5. Inyectar lentamente el agua, permitiendo que corra por la pared del vial\n6. Agitar suavemente (no sacudir) hasta que esté completamente disuelto\n7.

Este mecanismo de acción dual único distingue al Tirzepatide de los agonistas de receptores GLP-1 de objetivo único como el semaglutide, convirtiéndolo en una herramienta invaluable para la investigación metabólica.\n\nLa estructura del péptido incorpora una secuencia GIP modificada con sustituciones de aminoácidos cuidadosamente diseñadas y una cadena lateral de diácido graso C20 unida a la lisina. Esta modificación permite la unión a la albúmina sérica, extendiendo la vida media biológica a aproximadamente cinco días y permitiendo a los investigadores estudiar la activación sostenida de receptores duales.\n\nPeptide Shop suministra **Tirzepatide de grado de investigación** con pureza garantizada ≥99%, verificada mediante análisis HPLC y espectrometría de masas completa. Cada pedido incluye un Certificado de Análisis detallado para garantizar que los investigadores reciban material correctamente caracterizado para sus estudios.\n\n## ¿Cómo Funciona el Tirzepatide?\n\nEl Tirzepatide ejerce sus efectos biológicos a través de la activación simultánea de los receptores GIP y GLP-1, que son ambos receptores acoplados a proteína G expresados en varios tejidos metabólicamente activos. Este agonismo dual crea efectos de señalización sinérgicos que los investigadores continúan caracterizando.\n\n### Activación Dual de Receptores Incretinas\n\nEl receptor GIP se expresa predominantemente en células beta pancreáticas y tejido adiposo, mientras que los receptores GLP-1 se encuentran en los islotes pancreáticos, cerebro, corazón y tracto gastrointestinal. Al activar ambos sistemas de receptores simultáneamente, el Tirzepatide proporciona a los investigadores una herramienta única para estudiar:\n\n- **Secreción sinérgica de insulina** - La señalización combinada de GIP y GLP-1 mejora la liberación de insulina dependiente de glucosa más allá de lo que logra cualquier hormona sola\n- **Efectos metabólicos mejorados** - La activación dual puede mejorar la sensibilidad a la insulina a través de mecanismos distintos de los péptidos de agonista único\n- **Mejores resultados de peso** - La investigación sugiere que el mecanismo dual puede proporcionar efectos superiores de pérdida de peso en comparación con los mono-agonistas GLP-1\n\n## Aplicaciones de Investigación del Tirzepatide\n\n### Investigación Comparativa de Incretinas\n\nEl Tirzepatide permite estudios comparativos cruciales entre:\n\n- Agonistas simples del receptor GLP-1 vs agonismo dual GIP/GLP-1\n- Efectos específicos del receptor GIP en la regulación metabólica\n- Perfiles de selectividad de receptores y sus consecuencias fisiológicas\n\n### Estudios del Síndrome Metabólico\n\nEl agonista dual es valioso para investigar:\n\n- **Coordinación metabólica multiorgánica** - Entender cómo la señalización dual de incretinas afecta el metabolismo de todo el cuerpo\n- **Mecanismos de resistencia a la insulina** - Estudiar mejoras potenciales en la sensibilidad periférica a la insulina\n- **Producción hepática de glucosa** - Investigar efectos sobre el metabolismo hepático\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide: Diferencias Clave de Investigación\n\n| Característica | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|----------------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Objetivos de Receptor** | GIP + GLP-1 (dual) | Solo GLP-1 |\n| **Vida Media** | ~5 días | ~7 días |\n| **Peso Molecular** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Modificación de Ácido Graso** | Diácido C20 | Diácido C18 |\n| **Enfoque de Investigación** | Sinergia dual de incretinas | Mecanismos específicos de GLP-1 |\n\n## Especificaciones del Péptido Tirzepatide\n\n| Especificación | Detalle |\n|----------------|---------|\n| **Número CAS** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Fórmula Molecular** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Peso Molecular** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Pureza** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Apariencia** | Polvo liofilizado blanco a blanquecino |\n| **Solubilidad** | Soluble en agua; puede requerir calentamiento suave |\n| **Identidad** | Confirmada por espectrometría de masas |\n\n## ¿Por qué elegir Peptide Shop para Tirzepatide?\n\n### Pureza Verificada\n\nNuestro Tirzepatide se somete a pruebas de calidad rigurosas con pureza ≥99% verificada por HPLC.

Cela la rend idéale pour reconstituer les peptides lyophilisés (séchés par congélation) pour les applications de recherche où plusieurs prélèvements du même flacon sont nécessaires.\n\n## Caractéristiques Principales\n\n### Qualité USP\nNotre eau bactériostatique répond aux normes United States Pharmacopeia (USP) pour:\n- Stérilité\n- Pureté  \n- Concentration d'alcool benzylique (0,9%)\n- Niveaux d'endotoxines\n\n### Conception Multi-Usage\nContrairement à l'eau stérile à usage unique, l'eau bactériostatique permet plusieurs prélèvements sur plusieurs semaines sans risque de contamination, ce qui la rend économique pour les laboratoires de recherche.\n\n### Taille Pratique de 10ml\nChaque flacon de 10ml peut reconstituer 5-10 flacons de peptides selon les exigences de concentration.\n\n## Comment Utiliser l'Eau Bactériostatique\n\n### Étapes de Reconstitution\n1. Laisser le flacon de peptide atteindre la température ambiante\n2. Nettoyer les deux bouchons de flacon avec un tampon alcoolisé\n3. À l'aide d'une seringue stérile, prélever la quantité souhaitée d'eau bactériostatique\n4. Insérer l'aiguille dans le flacon de peptide, en visant la paroi de verre\n5. Injecter lentement l'eau, en la laissant couler le long de la paroi du flacon\n6. Agiter doucement (ne pas secouer) jusqu'à dissolution complète\n7.

Ce double mécanisme d'action unique distingue le Tirzepatide des agonistes des récepteurs GLP-1 à cible unique comme le semaglutide, en faisant un outil inestimable pour la recherche métabolique.\n\nLa structure du peptide incorpore une séquence GIP modifiée avec des substitutions d'acides aminés soigneusement conçues et une chaîne latérale diacide gras C20 attachée à la lysine. Cette modification permet la liaison à l'albumine sérique, prolongeant la demi-vie biologique à environ cinq jours et permettant aux chercheurs d'étudier l'activation soutenue des doubles récepteurs.\n\nPeptide Shop fournit du **Tirzepatide de qualité recherche** avec une pureté garantie ≥99%, vérifiée par analyse HPLC et spectrométrie de masse complète. Chaque commande comprend un Certificat d'Analyse détaillé pour garantir que les chercheurs reçoivent du matériel correctement caractérisé pour leurs études.\n\n## Comment fonctionne le Tirzepatide ?\n\nLe Tirzepatide exerce ses effets biologiques par l'activation simultanée des récepteurs GIP et GLP-1, qui sont tous deux des récepteurs couplés aux protéines G exprimés dans divers tissus métaboliquement actifs. Ce double agonisme crée des effets de signalisation synergiques que les chercheurs continuent de caractériser.\n\n### Activation Double des Récepteurs Incrétines\n\nLe récepteur GIP est principalement exprimé dans les cellules bêta pancréatiques et le tissu adipeux, tandis que les récepteurs GLP-1 se trouvent dans les îlots pancréatiques, le cerveau, le cœur et le tractus gastro-intestinal. En activant simultanément les deux systèmes de récepteurs, le Tirzepatide offre aux chercheurs un outil unique pour étudier :\n\n- **Sécrétion synergique d'insuline** - La signalisation combinée GIP et GLP-1 améliore la libération d'insuline dépendante du glucose au-delà de ce que chaque hormone réalise seule\n- **Effets métaboliques améliorés** - L'activation double peut améliorer la sensibilité à l'insuline par des mécanismes distincts des peptides à agoniste unique\n- **Résultats de poids améliorés** - La recherche suggère que le mécanisme double peut fournir des effets supérieurs de perte de poids par rapport aux mono-agonistes GLP-1\n\n## Applications de Recherche du Tirzepatide\n\n### Recherche Comparative sur les Incrétines\n\nLe Tirzepatide permet des études comparatives cruciales entre :\n\n- Les agonistes simples du récepteur GLP-1 vs le double agonisme GIP/GLP-1\n- Les effets spécifiques du récepteur GIP dans la régulation métabolique\n- Les profils de sélectivité des récepteurs et leurs conséquences physiologiques\n\n### Études sur le Syndrome Métabolique\n\nL'agoniste double est précieux pour étudier :\n\n- **Coordination métabolique multi-organes** - Comprendre comment la signalisation double incrétine affecte le métabolisme du corps entier\n- **Mécanismes de résistance à l'insuline** - Étudier les améliorations potentielles de la sensibilité périphérique à l'insuline\n- **Production hépatique de glucose** - Étudier les effets sur le métabolisme hépatique\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide : Différences Clés de Recherche\n\n| Caractéristique | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|-----------------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Cibles Récepteurs** | GIP + GLP-1 (double) | GLP-1 uniquement |\n| **Demi-vie** | ~5 jours | ~7 jours |\n| **Poids Moléculaire** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Modification Acide Gras** | Diacide C20 | Diacide C18 |\n| **Focus Recherche** | Synergie double incrétine | Mécanismes spécifiques GLP-1 |\n\n## Spécifications du Peptide Tirzepatide\n\n| Spécification | Détail |\n|---------------|--------|\n| **Numéro CAS** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Formule Moléculaire** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Poids Moléculaire** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Pureté** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Apparence** | Poudre lyophilisée blanche à blanc cassé |\n| **Solubilité** | Soluble dans l'eau ; peut nécessiter un réchauffement doux |\n| **Identité** | Confirmée par spectrométrie de masse |\n\n## Pourquoi choisir Peptide Shop pour le Tirzepatide ?\n\n### Pureté Vérifiée\n\nNotre Tirzepatide subit des tests de qualité rigoureux avec une pureté ≥99% vérifiée par HPLC.

Questo la rende ideale per ricostituire peptidi liofilizzati (essiccati a freddo) per applicazioni di ricerca dove sono necessari prelievi multipli dalla stessa fiala.\n\n## Caratteristiche Principali\n\n### Qualità USP\nLa nostra acqua batteriostatica soddisfa gli standard United States Pharmacopeia (USP) per:\n- Sterilità\n- Purezza  \n- Concentrazione di alcol benzilico (0,9%)\n- Livelli di endotossine\n\n### Design Multi-Uso\nA differenza dell'acqua sterile monouso, l'acqua batteriostatica consente prelievi multipli per diverse settimane senza rischio di contaminazione, rendendola economica per i laboratori di ricerca.\n\n### Pratica Dimensione da 10ml\nOgni fiala da 10ml può ricostituire 5-10 fiale di peptidi a seconda dei requisiti di concentrazione.\n\n## Come Usare l'Acqua Batteriostatica\n\n### Passaggi di Ricostituzione\n1. Lasciare che la fiala di peptide raggiunga la temperatura ambiente\n2. Pulire entrambi i tappi delle fiale con un tampone alcolico\n3. Usando una siringa sterile, prelevare la quantità desiderata di acqua batteriostatica\n4. Inserire l'ago nella fiala di peptide, puntando verso la parete di vetro\n5. Iniettare lentamente l'acqua, lasciandola scorrere lungo la parete della fiala\n6. Agitare delicatamente (non scuotere) fino a completa dissoluzione\n7.

Essenziale per i nostri studi sui meccanismi incretinici.","## Cos'è il Tirzepatide?\n\n**Il Tirzepatide** è un nuovo peptide sintetico che funziona come agonista doppio di due recettori chiave degli ormoni incretinici: il polipeptide insulinotropico glucosio-dipendente (GIP) e il peptide-1 simile al glucagone (GLP-1). Questo meccanismo d'azione doppio unico distingue il Tirzepatide dagli agonisti dei recettori GLP-1 a singolo bersaglio come il semaglutide, rendendolo uno strumento inestimabile per la ricerca metabolica.\n\nLa struttura del peptide incorpora una sequenza GIP modificata con sostituzioni di amminoacidi accuratamente progettate e una catena laterale di diacido grasso C20 attaccata alla lisina. Questa modifica consente il legame con l'albumina sierica, estendendo l'emivita biologica a circa cinque giorni e permettendo ai ricercatori di studiare l'attivazione sostenuta dei doppi recettori.\n\nPeptide Shop fornisce **Tirzepatide di grado di ricerca** con purezza garantita ≥99%, verificata tramite analisi HPLC e spettrometria di massa completa. Ogni ordine include un Certificato di Analisi dettagliato per garantire che i ricercatori ricevano materiale correttamente caratterizzato per i loro studi.\n\n## Come Funziona il Tirzepatide?\n\nIl Tirzepatide esercita i suoi effetti biologici attraverso l'attivazione simultanea dei recettori GIP e GLP-1, che sono entrambi recettori accoppiati a proteine G espressi in vari tessuti metabolicamente attivi. Questo doppio agonismo crea effetti di segnalazione sinergici che i ricercatori continuano a caratterizzare.\n\n### Attivazione Doppia dei Recettori Incretinici\n\nIl recettore GIP è espresso prevalentemente nelle cellule beta pancreatiche e nel tessuto adiposo, mentre i recettori GLP-1 si trovano nelle isole pancreatiche, nel cervello, nel cuore e nel tratto gastrointestinale. Attivando simultaneamente entrambi i sistemi recettoriali, il Tirzepatide fornisce ai ricercatori uno strumento unico per studiare:\n\n- **Secrezione sinergica di insulina** - La segnalazione combinata di GIP e GLP-1 migliora il rilascio di insulina glucosio-dipendente oltre quanto raggiunge ciascun ormone da solo\n- **Effetti metabolici migliorati** - L'attivazione doppia può migliorare la sensibilità all'insulina attraverso meccanismi distinti dai peptidi a singolo agonista\n- **Migliori risultati sul peso** - La ricerca suggerisce che il meccanismo doppio può fornire effetti superiori sulla perdita di peso rispetto ai mono-agonisti GLP-1\n\n## Applicazioni di Ricerca del Tirzepatide\n\n### Ricerca Comparativa sulle Incretine\n\nIl Tirzepatide consente studi comparativi cruciali tra:\n\n- Agonisti singoli del recettore GLP-1 vs agonismo doppio GIP/GLP-1\n- Effetti specifici del recettore GIP nella regolazione metabolica\n- Profili di selettività dei recettori e le loro conseguenze fisiologiche\n\n### Studi sulla Sindrome Metabolica\n\nL'agonista doppio è prezioso per investigare:\n\n- **Coordinazione metabolica multi-organo** - Comprendere come la segnalazione doppia delle incretine influenza il metabolismo dell'intero corpo\n- **Meccanismi di resistenza all'insulina** - Studiare potenziali miglioramenti nella sensibilità periferica all'insulina\n- **Produzione epatica di glucosio** - Investigare gli effetti sul metabolismo epatico\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide: Differenze Chiave di Ricerca\n\n| Caratteristica | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|----------------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Obiettivi Recettoriali** | GIP + GLP-1 (doppio) | Solo GLP-1 |\n| **Emivita** | ~5 giorni | ~7 giorni |\n| **Peso Molecolare** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Modifica Acido Grasso** | Diacido C20 | Diacido C18 |\n| **Focus di Ricerca** | Sinergia doppia incretinica | Meccanismi specifici GLP-1 |\n\n## Specifiche del Peptide Tirzepatide\n\n| Specifica | Dettaglio |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| **Numero CAS** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Formula Molecolare** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Peso Molecolare** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Purezza** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Aspetto** | Polvere liofilizzata da bianca a biancastra |\n| **Solubilità** | Solubile in acqua; può richiedere riscaldamento delicato |\n| **Identità** | Confermata da spettrometria di massa |\n\n## Perché scegliere Peptide Shop per Tirzepatide?\n\n### Purezza Verificata\n\nIl nostro Tirzepatide è sottoposto a rigorosi test di qualità con purezza ≥99% verificata da HPLC.

Dit maakt het ideaal voor het reconstitueren van gelyofiliseerde (gevriesdroogde) peptiden voor onderzoekstoepassingen waarbij meerdere onttrekkingen uit dezelfde flacon nodig zijn.\n\n## Belangrijkste Kenmerken\n\n### USP Kwaliteit\nOns bacteriostatisch water voldoet aan United States Pharmacopeia (USP) normen voor:\n- Steriliteit\n- Zuiverheid  \n- Benzylalcohol concentratie (0,9%)\n- Endotoxine niveaus\n\n### Multi-Use Ontwerp\nIn tegenstelling tot steriel water voor eenmalig gebruik, maakt bacteriostatisch water meerdere onttrekkingen over meerdere weken mogelijk zonder besmettingsrisico, wat het kosteneffectief maakt voor onderzoekslaboratoria.\n\n### Handige 10ml Maat\nElke 10ml flacon kan 5-10 peptide flacons reconstitueren, afhankelijk van concentratie-eisen.\n\n## Hoe Bacteriostatisch Water te Gebruiken\n\n### Reconstitutie Stappen\n1. Laat de peptide flacon op kamertemperatuur komen\n2. Reinig beide flacontoppen met een alcoholdoekje\n3. Trek met een steriele spuit de gewenste hoeveelheid bacteriostatisch water op\n4. Steek de naald in de peptide flacon, gericht op de glaswand\n5. Injecteer het water langzaam, zodat het langs de flaconwand loopt\n6. Draai voorzichtig (niet schudden) totdat volledig opgelost\n7.

Essentieel voor onze incretine-mechanismestudies.","## Wat is Tirzepatide?\n\n**Tirzepatide** is een nieuw synthetisch peptide dat functioneert als een duale agonist van twee belangrijke incretine-hormoonreceptoren: glucose-afhankelijk insulinotroop polypeptide (GIP) en glucagon-achtig peptide-1 (GLP-1). Dit unieke dubbele werkingsmechanisme onderscheidt Tirzepatide van single-target GLP-1-receptor agonisten zoals semaglutide, waardoor het een onmisbaar instrument is voor metabool onderzoek.\n\nDe structuur van het peptide bevat een gemodificeerde GIP-sequentie met zorgvuldig ontworpen aminozuursubstituties en een C20 vetzuur-diacid zijketen bevestigd aan lysine. Deze modificatie maakt binding aan serumalbumine mogelijk, waardoor de biologische halfwaardetijd wordt verlengd tot ongeveer vijf dagen en onderzoekers aanhoudende duale receptoractivatie kunnen bestuderen.\n\nPeptide Shop levert **onderzoekskwaliteit Tirzepatide** met gegarandeerde ≥99% zuiverheid, geverifieerd door uitgebreide HPLC- en massaspectrometrie-analyse. Elke bestelling bevat een gedetailleerd Analysecertificaat om ervoor te zorgen dat onderzoekers correct gekarakteriseerd materiaal ontvangen voor hun studies.\n\n## Hoe Werkt Tirzepatide?\n\nTirzepatide oefent zijn biologische effecten uit door gelijktijdige activatie van GIP- en GLP-1-receptoren, die beide G-eiwit-gekoppelde receptoren zijn die tot expressie komen in verschillende metabool actieve weefsels. Dit duale agonisme creëert synergetische signaaleffecten die onderzoekers blijven karakteriseren.\n\n### Duale Incretine Receptor Activatie\n\nDe GIP-receptor komt voornamelijk tot expressie in pancreatische bètacellen en vetweefsel, terwijl GLP-1-receptoren worden gevonden in pancreatische eilandjes, hersenen, hart en maag-darmkanaal. Door beide receptorsystemen gelijktijdig te activeren, biedt Tirzepatide onderzoekers een uniek instrument voor het bestuderen van:\n\n- **Synergetische insulinesecretie** - Gecombineerde GIP- en GLP-1-signalering verbetert glucose-afhankelijke insuline-afgifte meer dan elk hormoon alleen bereikt\n- **Verbeterde metabole effecten** - Duale activatie kan de insulinegevoeligheid verbeteren via mechanismen die verschillen van single-agonist peptiden\n- **Verbeterde gewichtsuitkomsten** - Onderzoek suggereert dat het dubbele mechanisme superieure gewichtsverlieseffecten kan bieden in vergelijking met GLP-1 mono-agonisten\n\n## Onderzoekstoepassingen van Tirzepatide\n\n### Vergelijkend Incretine Onderzoek\n\nTirzepatide maakt cruciale vergelijkende studies mogelijk tussen:\n\n- Single GLP-1-receptor agonisten versus duale GIP/GLP-1 agonisme\n- GIP-receptor-specifieke effecten in metabole regulatie\n- Receptorselectiviteitsprofielen en hun fysiologische consequenties\n\n### Metabool Syndroom Studies\n\nDe duale agonist is waardevol voor het onderzoeken van:\n\n- **Multi-orgaan metabole coördinatie** - Begrijpen hoe duale incretine-signalering het metabolisme van het hele lichaam beïnvloedt\n- **Insulineresistentiemechanismen** - Bestuderen van potentiële verbeteringen in perifere insulinegevoeligheid\n- **Hepatische glucoseproductie** - Onderzoeken van effecten op levermetabolisme\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide: Belangrijkste Onderzoeksverschillen\n\n| Kenmerk | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Receptor Targets** | GIP + GLP-1 (duaal) | Alleen GLP-1 |\n| **Halfwaardetijd** | ~5 dagen | ~7 dagen |\n| **Molecuulgewicht** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Vetzuurmodificatie** | C20 diacid | C18 diacid |\n| **Onderzoeksfocus** | Duale incretine synergie | GLP-1 specifieke mechanismen |\n\n## Tirzepatide Peptide Specificaties\n\n| Specificatie | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Nummer** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Moleculaire Formule** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Molecuulgewicht** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Zuiverheid** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Uiterlijk** | Wit tot gebroken wit gelyofiliseerd poeder |\n| **Oplosbaarheid** | Oplosbaar in water; kan voorzichtige verwarming vereisen |\n| **Identiteit** | Bevestigd door massaspectrometrie |\n\n## Waarom Kiezen voor Peptide Shop voor Tirzepatide?\n\n### Geverifieerde Zuiverheid\n\nOnze Tirzepatide ondergaat strenge kwaliteitstesten met ≥99% zuiverheid geverifieerd door HPLC.
