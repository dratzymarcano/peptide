It is ubiquitous in both human and animal cells. This product is sold exclusively for **laboratory research and in-vitro use**. It is strictly prohibited for human use.\n\n## Research Context\n\nThymosin Beta-4 plays a vital role in the regulation of actin polymerization, a fundamental process in cell structure and motility. TB-500 is widely used in research models to study cell migration and tissue regeneration mechanisms.\n\n### Key Areas of Investigation\n\n*   **Actin Sequestration:** TB-500 binds to monomeric actin (G-actin), preventing polymerization into filaments. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining the pool of available actin monomers in cells.\n*   **Cell Migration:** Research indicates that Thymosin Beta-4 promotes the migration of endothelial cells and keratinocytes, which is a key component of wound healing models.\n*   **Anti-Inflammatory Pathways:** Studies have observed the peptide's influence on downregulating inflammatory cytokines in various tissue models.\n*   **Cardiac Research:** *In-vivo* animal studies have explored the potential of Thymosin Beta-4 to promote cardiomyocyte survival and migration following ischemic injury.\n\n## Chemical Properties\n\n*   **Sequence:** Ac-Ser-DKP-Asp-Lys-Pro-Asp-Leu-Ala-Glu-Ile-Lys-Phe-Asp-Lys-Ser-Lys-Leu-Lys-Lys-Thr-Glu-Thr-Gln-Glu-Lys-N\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C212H350N56O78S\n*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.\n*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.\n\n## Handling and Storage\n\n*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C. Stable for up to 2 years.\n*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C. Use within 1 week. For longer storage, aliquot and freeze at -20°C.\n\n## Quality Assurance\n\n*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).\n*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).\n*   **Endotoxin:** Tested to ensure suitability for cell culture applications.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)\n\n**Q: Can this be used for injury recovery in athletes?**\nA: No. This product is for research purposes only. Any use in humans, including athletes, is strictly prohibited and may violate WADA regulations.\n\n**Q: What is the difference between TB-500 and Thymosin Beta-4?**\nA: In the research reagent market, \"TB-500\" is often used as a synonym for the synthetic sequence of Thymosin Beta-4. However, strictly speaking, TB-500 refers to a specific fragment (17-23) in some contexts, while the full length is Thymosin Beta-4. Our product is the full sequence unless otherwise noted in the COA.\n\n**Q: Is this product sterile?**\nA: The lyophilized powder is processed in a clean environment but is not certified as a sterile pharmaceutical product. It should be filtered (0.22 µm) if used in sterile cell culture.","src/content/products/tb-500.md","6c5d91ddcd60f3e5",{"html":1129,"metadata":1130},"\u003Ch1 id=\"buy-tb-500-thymosin-beta-4-for-research\">Buy TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4) for Research\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>TB-500\u003C/strong> is a synthetic version of the naturally occurring peptide Thymosin Beta-4.
