Proper storage techniques to maintain purity and extend shelf life.","## Why Proper Storage Matters\n\nPeptides are sensitive molecules that can degrade when exposed to heat, moisture, light, or oxygen. Proper storage is essential to maintain the purity and activity of your research compounds.\n\nFollowing these guidelines will help ensure your peptides remain stable throughout your research project.\n\n## Storing Lyophilised (Freeze-Dried) Peptides\n\nLyophilised peptides are the most stable form for storage. Here's how to keep them in optimal condition:\n\n### Temperature\n\n- **Short-term (weeks)**: Store at -20°C\n- **Long-term (months to years)**: Store at -80°C for maximum stability\n- **Avoid**: Repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n\n### Protection from Moisture\n\nLyophilised peptides are hygroscopic—they readily absorb moisture from the air. To prevent this:\n\n- Keep vials sealed until ready for use\n- Allow vials to reach room temperature before opening (prevents condensation)\n- Use desiccants in storage containers\n- Work quickly when the vial is open\n\n### Light Protection\n\nMany peptides are photosensitive. Store in:\n\n- Original amber vials (if provided)\n- Dark storage boxes or wrapped in foil\n- Refrigerators/freezers away from fluorescent lighting\n\n## Reconstituting Peptides\n\nWhen you're ready to use your peptides, follow these reconstitution guidelines:\n\n### Choosing a Solvent\n\n- **Bacteriostatic water** - Most common, suitable for most peptides\n- **Sterile water** - For single-use applications\n- **Acetic acid (0.1%)** - For basic peptides that are difficult to dissolve\n- **DMSO** - For hydrophobic peptides (use minimal volume)\n\n### Reconstitution Process\n\n1. Calculate the volume needed for your desired concentration\n2. Add solvent slowly down the side of the vial\n3. Gently swirl—never vortex or shake vigorously\n4. Allow to dissolve completely (may take several minutes)\n5. If cloudiness persists, a small amount of acetic acid may help\n\n## Storing Reconstituted Peptides\n\nOnce in solution, peptides are less stable than their lyophilised form:\n\n### Short-term Storage (Days to Weeks)\n\n- Store at 2-8°C (refrigerator)\n- Use within 2-4 weeks for most peptides\n- Check for precipitation or cloudiness before each use\n\n### Long-term Storage (Weeks to Months)\n\n- Aliquot into single-use portions to avoid freeze-thaw cycles\n- Store aliquots at -20°C or -80°C\n- Label clearly with date, concentration, and contents\n\n## Peptide-Specific Considerations\n\nSome peptides require special handling:\n\n### GHK-Cu (Copper Peptide)\n\n- Highly hygroscopic—extra care with moisture\n- Solutions are typically blue due to copper content\n- Stable in solution at 4°C for extended periods\n\n### Cysteine-Containing Peptides\n\n- Prone to oxidation—minimise air exposure\n- Consider adding reducing agents to solutions\n- Use argon or nitrogen to displace air in vials\n\n### Large Peptides (>30 amino acids)\n\n- More sensitive to aggregation\n- May require specific buffer conditions\n- Consider sterile filtration after reconstitution\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Storage Condition | Lyophilised | Reconstituted |\n|-------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Room temperature | Days (sealed) | Hours |\n| Refrigerator (4°C) | Weeks | 2-4 weeks |\n| Freezer (-20°C) | Months | 1-2 months |\n| Deep freezer (-80°C) | Years | 3-6 months |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nProper storage and handling of peptides is fundamental to successful research. By following these guidelines, you can ensure your peptides maintain their purity and activity throughout your experiments.\n\nIf you have questions about specific peptide storage requirements, our technical team is always available to help.","src/content/blog/peptide-storage-handling-best-practices.md","5a453b5b387054f5",{"html":105,"metadata":106},"\u003Ch2 id=\"why-proper-storage-matters\">Why Proper Storage Matters\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Peptides are sensitive molecules that can degrade when exposed to heat, moisture, light, or oxygen.

This makes it ideal for reconstituting lyophilized (freeze-dried) peptides for research applications where multiple withdrawals from the same vial are needed.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### USP Grade Quality\nOur bacteriostatic water meets United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for:\n- Sterility\n- Purity  \n- Benzyl alcohol concentration (0.9%)\n- Endotoxin levels\n\n### Multi-Use Design\nUnlike single-use sterile water, bacteriostatic water allows multiple withdrawals over several weeks without contamination risk, making it cost-effective for research laboratories.\n\n### Convenient 10ml Size\nEach 10ml vial can reconstitute 5-10 peptide vials depending on concentration requirements.\n\n## How to Use Bacteriostatic Water\n\n### Reconstitution Steps\n1. Allow the peptide vial to reach room temperature\n2. Clean both vial tops with an alcohol swab\n3. Using a sterile syringe, withdraw the desired amount of bacteriostatic water\n4. Insert the needle into the peptide vial, aiming at the glass wall\n5. Slowly inject the water, allowing it to run down the vial wall\n6. Gently swirl (do not shake) until fully dissolved\n7.

This synthetic peptide was specifically designed to isolate the fat-metabolising properties of growth hormone without its growth-promoting or diabetogenic effects.\n\nOriginally developed by Metabolic Pharmaceuticals in Australia, AOD-9604 represents one of the most targeted approaches to studying growth hormone's lipolytic activity. By using only the fat-reducing portion of the full hormone, researchers can investigate adipose tissue metabolism without confounding effects on IGF-1 or glucose homeostasis.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade AOD-9604** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis.

Originally developed at the University of Arizona in the 1980s, this research peptide has become an essential tool for studying melanocortin receptor signalling and the regulation of skin pigmentation.\n\nThe peptide's cyclic lactam structure provides enhanced stability and receptor binding affinity compared to linear α-MSH analogues. Melanotan 2 acts as a non-selective agonist at melanocortin receptors MC1, MC3, MC4, and MC5, enabling researchers to study diverse physiological processes beyond pigmentation.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Melanotan 2** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis, ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Melanotan 2 Work?\n\nMelanotan 2 exerts its biological effects through activation of melanocortin receptors, a family of G protein-coupled receptors that regulate diverse physiological processes. Understanding these mechanisms is central to ongoing research in dermatology, endocrinology, and neuroscience.\n\n### Melanocortin Receptor Family\n\nMT-2 activates multiple melanocortin receptor subtypes:\n\n- **MC1R** - Primarily expressed in melanocytes; regulates skin pigmentation\n- **MC3R** - Expressed in hypothalamus and peripheral tissues; involved in energy homeostasis\n- **MC4R** - Central nervous system expression; regulates appetite and sexual function\n- **MC5R** - Sebaceous glands and other tissues; less well characterised\n\n### Melanogenesis Pathway\n\nThe primary research application involves studying skin pigmentation:\n\n- **MC1R activation** - Triggers intracellular cAMP production in melanocytes\n- **MITF activation** - Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor upregulation\n- **Tyrosinase expression** - Key enzyme in melanin synthesis pathway\n- **Eumelanin production** - Brown-black pigment providing UV protection\n- **Melanosome transfer** - Distribution of pigment to keratinocytes\n\n### Central Nervous System Effects\n\nMT-2's non-selective receptor profile enables diverse CNS research:\n\n- **Appetite regulation** - MC4R activation in hypothalamus suppresses food intake\n- **Energy expenditure** - Effects on metabolic rate through central mechanisms\n- **Sexual behaviour** - Research on erectile function and libido in animal models\n- **Anxiolytic effects** - Studies on stress and anxiety-related behaviours\n\n### Anti-Inflammatory Research\n\nEmerging research explores melanocortin anti-inflammatory properties:\n\n- **Cytokine modulation** - Effects on inflammatory mediator production\n- **Immune cell function** - Research on macrophage and lymphocyte behaviour\n- **Tissue protection** - Studies on inflammation-related damage\n\n## Research Applications of Melanotan 2\n\n### Pigmentation Research\n\nMelanotan 2 is extensively used in dermatological research:\n\n- **Melanogenesis mechanisms** - Understanding pigment production pathways\n- **UV protection** - Research on natural photoprotection\n- **Vitiligo models** - Studies on repigmentation strategies\n- **Melanoma biology** - Understanding MC1R role in melanocyte transformation\n- **Skin ageing** - Research on photoprotection and pigmentary changes\n\n### Appetite and Obesity Research\n\nMC4R activation makes MT-2 valuable for metabolic studies:\n\n- **Food intake regulation** - Investigating central appetite control mechanisms\n- **Satiety signalling** - Research on post-prandial fullness pathways\n- **Energy homeostasis** - Studies on metabolic regulation\n- **Obesity models** - Investigating potential intervention targets\n\n### Sexual Function Studies\n\nResearch into melanocortin effects on sexual behaviour:\n\n- **Erectile function** - Studies on central arousal mechanisms\n- **Female sexual function** - Research on desire and response pathways\n- **Receptor pharmacology** - Understanding MC4R role in sexual behaviour\n\n### Inflammatory Disease Models\n\nAnti-inflammatory properties are actively investigated:\n\n- **Arthritis models** - Research on joint inflammation\n- **Inflammatory bowel disease** - Studies on gut inflammation\n- **Neuroinflammation** - Research on brain inflammatory conditions\n- **Tissue repair** - Investigating healing in inflammatory contexts\n\n### Skin Disorder Research\n\nDermatological applications extend beyond pigmentation:\n\n- **Photoprotection mechanisms** - Understanding skin UV defence\n- **Skin barrier function** - Research on epidermal integrity\n- **Wound healing** - Studies on melanocyte contribution to repair\n\n## Melanotan 2 vs Melanotan 1: Key Differences\n\nResearchers often compare these related peptides:\n\n| Feature | Melanotan 2 | Melanotan 1 |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Structure** | Cyclic heptapeptide | Linear tridecapeptide |\n| **Receptor Selectivity** | Non-selective (MC1/3/4/5) | MC1R selective |\n| **Research Focus** | Multiple applications | Pigmentation focused |\n| **CNS Effects** | Significant | Minimal |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 1024.2 g/mol | 1646.9 g/mol |\n| **Stability** | High (cyclic) | Moderate (linear) |\n\nBoth peptides are available from Peptide Shop for comparative research studies.\n\n## Melanotan 2 Peptide Specifications\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 121062-08-6 |\n| **Molecular Formula** | C₅₀H₆₉N₁₅O₉ |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 1024.2 g/mol |\n| **Sequence** | Ac-Nle-cyclo[Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-NH₂ |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Freely soluble in water |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Protocol\n\nMelanotan 2 is straightforward to prepare for research use:\n\n1. **Allow vial to reach room temperature** before opening\n2. **Calculate desired concentration** -

Our new preferred supplier.","## What is Semaglutide?\n\n**Semaglutide** is a synthetic analogue of human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone naturally produced in the intestines that plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and appetite regulation. This research peptide has gained significant attention in scientific communities worldwide for its applications in metabolic research, particularly in studies related to type 2 diabetes and obesity. For comprehensive background information, see the [PubChem compound entry for Semaglutide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Semaglutide){:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"}.\n\nThe molecular structure of Semaglutide features a unique C-18 fatty diacid chain attached to the lysine residue at position 26. This structural modification enables the peptide to bind to serum albumin, dramatically extending its biological half-life to approximately seven days. This prolonged activity profile makes Semaglutide an invaluable tool for researchers studying sustained GLP-1 receptor activation mechanisms.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Semaglutide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified by HPLC analysis and mass spectrometry. Every order includes a comprehensive Certificate of Analysis (COA), ensuring researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Semaglutide Work?\n\nSemaglutide exerts its biological effects through high-affinity binding to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in various tissues including pancreatic beta cells, the central nervous system, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. Upon receptor binding, Semaglutide initiates several downstream signalling cascades that researchers continue to investigate.\n\n### Pancreatic Effects\n\nIn pancreatic beta cells, GLP-1 receptor activation by Semaglutide triggers glucose-dependent insulin secretion through the cAMP-PKA signalling pathway. This glucose-dependent mechanism is particularly noteworthy in research, as it suggests reduced risk of hypoglycaemia compared to insulin secretagogues that work independently of glucose levels.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that Semaglutide may also promote beta-cell proliferation and reduce apoptosis in preclinical models, suggesting potential applications in studying beta-cell preservation strategies.\n\n### Central Nervous System Actions\n\nSemaglutide crosses the blood-brain barrier and activates GLP-1 receptors in key hypothalamic regions involved in appetite regulation, including the arcuate nucleus and paraventricular nucleus. Research indicates that this central action contributes to reduced food intake and altered food preferences in animal models.\n\nEmerging research also explores Semaglutide's potential neuroprotective properties, with studies investigating its effects in models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke.\n\n### Gastrointestinal Effects\n\nGLP-1 receptor activation slows gastric emptying, which may contribute to prolonged satiety and reduced postprandial glucose excursions. Researchers studying gut-brain axis signalling find Semaglutide particularly useful for investigating these gastrointestinal regulatory mechanisms.\n\n## Research Applications of Semaglutide\n\n### Metabolic Research\n\nSemaglutide is extensively used in metabolic research laboratories studying:\n\n- **Glucose homeostasis mechanisms** - Understanding how GLP-1 receptor activation influences blood glucose regulation\n- **Insulin secretion dynamics** - Investigating the molecular pathways governing glucose-dependent insulin release\n- **Beta-cell biology** - Studying potential regenerative and protective effects on pancreatic beta cells\n- **Glucagon suppression** - Researching the relationship between GLP-1 signalling and alpha-cell function\n\n### Weight Management Studies\n\nThe peptide's effects on body weight have made it crucial for obesity research, including studies on:\n\n- **Appetite regulation** - Investigating central mechanisms controlling food intake and satiety\n- **Energy expenditure** - Studying metabolic rate changes associated with GLP-1 receptor activation\n- **Food preference alteration** - Researching how GLP-1 signalling affects dietary choices in animal models\n- **Adipose tissue biology** - Understanding effects on fat storage and metabolism\n\n### Cardiovascular Research\n\nEmerging evidence suggests GLP-1 receptor agonists may have cardiovascular effects beyond glucose control, leading to research investigating:\n\n- **Endothelial function** - Studying vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties\n- **Cardiac metabolism** - Investigating effects on myocardial glucose and fatty acid utilisation\n- **Atherosclerosis progression** - Researching potential anti-atherogenic mechanisms\n\n### Neuroscience Applications\n\nThe presence of GLP-1 receptors in the brain has sparked significant neuroscience research using Semaglutide:\n\n- **Neurodegeneration models** - Investigating potential protective effects in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models\n- **Stroke recovery** - Studying effects on neuronal survival and functional recovery\n- **Cognitive function** - Researching impacts on learning and memory in animal models\n\n## Semaglutide Peptide Specifications\n\nOur research-grade Semaglutide meets the highest quality standards required for reproducible scientific research:\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 910463-68-2 |\n| **Molecular Formula** | C₁₈₇H₂₉₁N₄₅O₅₉ |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Sequence** | Modified GLP-1 (7-37) with Aib at position 8 and C-18 fatty diacid at Lys-26 |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in water at pH >7.0; slightly alkaline buffer recommended |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Protocol\n\nFor optimal results in research applications, follow these reconstitution guidelines:\n\n1. **Allow the vial to reach room temperature** before opening to prevent moisture condensation on the lyophilised peptide\n2. **Calculate the required concentration** for your research application\n3. **Use sterile bacteriostatic water** or a slightly alkaline buffer (pH 7.4-8.0) as the reconstitution vehicle\n4. **Add the solvent slowly** along the vial wall, not directly onto the peptide\n5. **Gently swirl the vial** to dissolve - never shake vigorously as this may cause peptide degradation\n6. **Ensure complete dissolution** before aliquoting for experiments\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n| Condition | Storage Temperature | Recommended Duration |\n|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | Up to 4 weeks |\n| **Working aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 3 months |\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n- Protect from light during storage\n- Store in airtight containers to prevent moisture absorption\n- Use sterile technique during handling\n\n## Why Choose Peptide Shop for Semaglutide?\n\n### Guaranteed Purity\n\nEvery batch of our Semaglutide undergoes rigorous quality control testing.

Product quality was exactly as described.","## What is Tirzepatide?\n\n**Tirzepatide** is a novel synthetic peptide that functions as a dual agonist of two key incretin hormone receptors: glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). This unique dual mechanism of action distinguishes Tirzepatide from single-target GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide, making it an invaluable tool for metabolic research.\n\nThe peptide's structure incorporates a modified GIP sequence with carefully engineered amino acid substitutions and a C20 fatty diacid side chain attached to lysine. This modification enables binding to serum albumin, extending the biological half-life to approximately five days and allowing researchers to study sustained dual receptor activation.\n\nPeptide Shop supplies **research-grade Tirzepatide** with guaranteed ≥99% purity, verified through comprehensive HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Each order includes a detailed Certificate of Analysis to ensure researchers receive properly characterised material for their studies.\n\n## How Does Tirzepatide Work?\n\nTirzepatide exerts its biological effects through simultaneous activation of GIP and GLP-1 receptors, both of which are G protein-coupled receptors expressed in various metabolically active tissues. This dual agonism creates synergistic signalling effects that researchers continue to characterise.\n\n### Dual Incretin Receptor Activation\n\nThe GIP receptor is predominantly expressed in pancreatic beta cells and adipose tissue, while GLP-1 receptors are found in pancreatic islets, brain, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. By activating both receptor systems simultaneously, Tirzepatide provides researchers with a unique tool for studying:\n\n- **Synergistic insulin secretion** - Combined GIP and GLP-1 signalling enhances glucose-dependent insulin release beyond what either hormone achieves alone\n- **Enhanced metabolic effects** - Dual activation may improve insulin sensitivity through mechanisms distinct from single-agonist peptides\n- **Improved weight outcomes** - Research suggests the dual mechanism may provide superior weight loss effects compared to GLP-1 mono-agonists\n\n### Pancreatic Beta-Cell Effects\n\nIn pancreatic beta cells, Tirzepatide activates both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, leading to:\n\n- **Enhanced cAMP production** through dual receptor stimulation\n- **Improved glucose sensing** and insulin granule exocytosis\n- **Potential beta-cell protective effects** under metabolic stress conditions\n- **Reduced glucagon secretion** from pancreatic alpha cells\n\n### Central Nervous System Actions\n\nLike GLP-1 agonists, Tirzepatide affects appetite regulation through central mechanisms. Research indicates effects on:\n\n- **Hypothalamic appetite centres** - Modulating food intake signalling\n- **Reward pathway activity** - Potentially influencing food preferences\n- **Gastric emptying rates** - Contributing to prolonged satiety\n\n### Adipose Tissue Effects\n\nThe GIP receptor component may provide unique effects on adipose tissue:\n\n- **Enhanced lipid metabolism** - GIP signalling influences adipocyte function\n- **Improved insulin sensitivity** - Fat tissue-specific effects may contribute to metabolic improvements\n- **Altered adipokine secretion** - Potential effects on adiponectin and leptin\n\n## Research Applications of Tirzepatide\n\n### Comparative Incretin Research\n\nTirzepatide enables crucial comparative studies between:\n\n- Single GLP-1 receptor agonists vs dual GIP/GLP-1 agonism\n- GIP receptor-specific effects in metabolic regulation\n- Receptor selectivity profiles and their physiological consequences\n\n### Metabolic Syndrome Studies\n\nThe dual agonist is valuable for investigating:\n\n- **Multi-organ metabolic coordination** - Understanding how dual incretin signalling affects whole-body metabolism\n- **Insulin resistance mechanisms** - Studying potential improvements in peripheral insulin sensitivity\n- **Hepatic glucose production** - Investigating effects on liver metabolism\n\n### Weight Management Research\n\nTirzepatide's superior weight outcomes in preclinical models make it essential for:\n\n- **Appetite regulation studies** - Comparing dual vs single agonist effects on food intake\n- **Energy expenditure research** - Investigating metabolic rate changes\n- **Adipose tissue biology** - Understanding fat mass reduction mechanisms\n\n### Cardiovascular Research\n\nEmerging areas of investigation include:\n\n- **Cardiac metabolism** - Effects on myocardial glucose and lipid utilisation\n- **Vascular function** - Potential endothelial effects of dual agonism\n- **Blood pressure regulation** - Understanding cardiovascular impacts\n\n### Diabetes Research\n\nCore applications in diabetes studies include:\n\n- **Beta-cell preservation** - Investigating protective effects on insulin-producing cells\n- **Glucose homeostasis** - Studying blood glucose regulation mechanisms\n- **Incretin physiology** - Understanding the incretin effect in normal and diabetic states\n\n## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide: Key Research Differences\n\n| Feature | Tirzepatide | Semaglutide |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Receptor Targets** | GIP + GLP-1 (dual) | GLP-1 only |\n| **Half-life** | ~5 days | ~7 days |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4813.45 g/mol | 4113.58 g/mol |\n| **Fatty Acid Modification** | C20 diacid | C18 diacid |\n| **Research Focus** | Dual incretin synergy | GLP-1 specific mechanisms |\n\nBoth peptides are available from Peptide Shop in research-grade purity, allowing direct comparison studies.\n\n## Tirzepatide Peptide Specifications\n\n| Specification | Detail |\n|--------------|--------|\n| **CAS Number** | 2023788-19-2 |\n| **Molecular Formula** | C₂₂₅H₃₄₈N₄₈O₆₈ |\n| **Molecular Weight** | 4813.45 g/mol |\n| **Purity** | ≥99% (HPLC) |\n| **Appearance** | White to off-white lyophilised powder |\n| **Solubility** | Soluble in water; may require gentle warming |\n| **Identity** | Confirmed by mass spectrometry |\n\n## Reconstitution and Handling Guidelines\n\n### Reconstitution Protocol\n\n1. **Equilibrate to room temperature** before opening the vial\n2. **Calculate required concentration** based on your experimental design\n3. **Add sterile bacteriostatic water** slowly along the vial wall\n4. **Gently swirl** to dissolve - avoid shaking\n5. **Allow complete dissolution** before use\n6. **Aliquot immediately** to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n| Condition | Temperature | Duration |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| **Lyophilised** | -20°C | Up to 24 months |\n| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | Up to 4 weeks |\n| **Working aliquots** | -20°C | Up to 3 months |\n\n## Why Choose Peptide Shop for Tirzepatide?\n\n### Verified Purity\n\nOur Tirzepatide undergoes rigorous quality testing with ≥99% purity verified by HPLC.
