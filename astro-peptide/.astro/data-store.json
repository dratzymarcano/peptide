For laboratory research use only.","# Buy CJC-1295 No DAC (Mod GRF 1-29)\n\n**CJC-1295 No DAC**, often referred to as **Mod GRF 1-29**, is a synthetic analogue of the endogenous Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH). It is modified to extend its half-life in plasma. **Sold for laboratory research use only.**\n\n## Research Context\n\nNative GHRH (1-29) has a very short half-life (minutes) due to rapid enzymatic degradation by DPP-IV. CJC-1295 No DAC incorporates four amino acid substitutions that protect it from this cleavage, making it a valuable tool for studying sustained GH release.\n\n### Key Areas of Investigation\n\n*   **Pulsatile GH Release:** Used to mimic the body's natural pulsatile secretion of growth hormone in animal studies.\n*   **Synergy Studies:** Often researched in combination with GHRPs (like Ipamorelin) to study synergistic effects on pituitary somatotrophs.\n*   **Sleep Research:** Investigated for its effects on slow-wave sleep patterns in rodent models.\n\n## Chemical Properties\n\n*   **Sequence:** Tyr-D-Ala-Asp-Ala-Ile-Phe-Thr-Gln-Ser-Tyr-Arg-Kv-Leu-Ala-Gln-Leu-Sark-Ala-Arg-Lys-Leu-Leu-Gln-Asp-Ile-Leu-Sark-Arg-NH2 (Substitutions applied)\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C152H252N44O42\n*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.\n*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.\n\n## Handling and Storage\n\n*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.\n*   **Reconstituted:** Store at 4°C. Use within 1-2 weeks.\n\n## Quality Assurance\n\n*   **Purity:** ≥98% (HPLC).\n*   **Identity:** Mass Spectrometry (MS).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (Research Only)\n\n**Q: What is the difference between \"DAC\" and \"No DAC\"?**\nA: \"DAC\" stands for Drug Affinity Complex. CJC-1295 *with* DAC binds to albumin, extending its half-life to days. \"No DAC\" (this product) has a half-life of roughly 30 minutes, which is ideal for mimicking natural pulsatile release in research.\n\n**Q: Is this product suitable for human injection?**\nA: No. It is a research chemical not approved for human use.","src/content/products/cjc-1295-no-dac.md","c5ea0bbcceb9e982",{"html":266,"metadata":267},"\u003Ch1 id=\"buy-cjc-1295-no-dac-mod-grf-1-29\">Buy CJC-1295 No DAC (Mod GRF 1-29)\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>CJC-1295 No DAC\u003C/strong>, often referred to as \u003Cstrong>Mod GRF 1-29\u003C/strong>, is a synthetic analogue of the endogenous Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH).

It is ubiquitous in both human and animal cells. This product is sold exclusively for **laboratory research and in-vitro use**. It is strictly prohibited for human use.\n\n## Research Context\n\nThymosin Beta-4 plays a vital role in the regulation of actin polymerization, a fundamental process in cell structure and motility. TB-500 is widely used in research models to study cell migration and tissue regeneration mechanisms.\n\n### Key Areas of Investigation\n\n*   **Actin Sequestration:** TB-500 binds to monomeric actin (G-actin), preventing polymerization into filaments. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining the pool of available actin monomers in cells.\n*   **Cell Migration:** Research indicates that Thymosin Beta-4 promotes the migration of endothelial cells and keratinocytes, which is a key component of wound healing models.\n*   **Anti-Inflammatory Pathways:** Studies have observed the peptide's influence on downregulating inflammatory cytokines in various tissue models.\n*   **Cardiac Research:** *In-vivo* animal studies have explored the potential of Thymosin Beta-4 to promote cardiomyocyte survival and migration following ischemic injury.\n\n## Chemical Properties\n\n*   **Sequence:** Ac-Ser-DKP-Asp-Lys-Pro-Asp-Leu-Ala-Glu-Ile-Lys-Phe-Asp-Lys-Ser-Lys-Leu-Lys-Lys-Thr-Glu-Thr-Gln-Glu-Lys-N\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C212H350N56O78S\n*   **Solubility:** Soluble in water.\n*   **Appearance:** White lyophilized powder.\n\n## Handling and Storage\n\n*   **Lyophilized:** Store at -20°C.
